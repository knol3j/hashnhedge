## Our Editorial Philosophy

Hash & Hedge exists in the grey areas where crypto, traditional finance, security, and culture overlap. We prioritize clarity, context, and evidence over clickbait and corporate cheerleading.

## Our Voice

We write with the raw honesty of Bukowski, the gonzo spirit of Hunter S. Thompson, the self-aware destruction of Doug Stanhope and Greg Giraldo, and the unflinching observations of Patrice O'Neal. This isn't edge for the sake of edge - it's authentic analysis that cuts through industry bullshit.

## Editorial Standards

**Fact-Checking & Sources:**
- We attribute facts to sources and link out for verification
- We distinguish between fact and opinion clearly
- We correct material errors promptly and transparently
- We don't publish speculation as fact

**Independence:**
- Editorial independence matters above all else
- We disclose any conflicts of interest
- Sponsored content is clearly labeled
- We don't shill for bags or projects

**Security Coverage Ethics:**
- No step-by-step exploitation instructions
- Focus on analysis, implications, and defense
- Responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities
- Educational intent over sensationalism

**AI Content Disclosure:**
- AI-assisted content is clearly labeled
- Human oversight on all published content
- AI is a tool, not a replacement for judgment
- Original research and analysis remains human-driven

## What We Cover

**Crypto & DeFi:**
- Market analysis with psychological insight
- Regulatory developments and their real implications
- Security vulnerabilities and exploits (responsibly)
- Cultural phenomena and community dynamics

**Technology & AI:**
- Security developments that actually matter
- AI hype vs. reality
- Privacy and surveillance issues
- Open source and decentralization

**Culture & Society:**
- Where tech meets art, comedy, and counterculture
- The human cost of technological change
- Financial systems and their discontents
- The intersection of technology and power

## What We Don't Do

- Pump specific tokens or projects
- Provide financial advice (this is commentary, not counsel)
- Publish unverified rumors as fact
- Engage in doxxing or personal attacks
- Compromise editorial integrity for revenue

## Corrections Policy

When we make mistakes (and we will), we correct them openly:
- Corrections are noted at the top of articles
- Original errors are struck through, not deleted
- We explain what was wrong and why
- We don't memory-hole our failures

## Reader Feedback

We actually read emails and comments. Disagree with our analysis? Think we missed something? Let us know. The best journalism happens in conversation with informed readers.
