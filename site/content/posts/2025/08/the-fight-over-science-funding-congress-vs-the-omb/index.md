Here's a news brief based on the provided source:  **Headline** Congress, OMB at Odds Over Science Funding Priorities  **Summary Meta Description** A budget battle is brewing between Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) over science funding priorities. While Congress seeks to maintain current levels of investment, OMB recommends reducing some programs to reallocate funds elsewhere.  **Key Points**  * Congress has proposed maintaining or increasing funding for several science agencies, including NASA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). * OMB recommends reducing funding for some programs, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E), to reallocate resources towards other areas. * The disagreement reflects fundamentally different approaches to allocating scientific research dollars.  **Short Takeaways**  * **Science Funding Stagnation**: While maintaining current levels of investment is a positive step, it may not be enough to address growing demands for scientific research and innovation. * **Prioritization Challenges**: The debate highlights the difficulties in prioritizing science funding amidst competing budgetary pressures and shifting national priorities.  **Sources** https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/analysis-funding-science-at-past-levels-is-only-half-the-battle/
