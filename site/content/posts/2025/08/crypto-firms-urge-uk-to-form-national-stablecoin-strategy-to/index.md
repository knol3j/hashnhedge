Here's the news brief:  **Headline** UK Crypto Firms Push for Stablecoin Strategy  **Summary Meta Description** The UK's crypto industry is urging the government to establish a national strategy for stablecoins, warning that inaction could lead to the country falling behind the US. A coalition of firms has signed an open letter calling on policymakers to develop guidelines and regulations for the growing sector.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó A group of 15 UK-based cryptocurrency companies have signed an open letter urging the government to create a national stablecoin strategy. ΓÇó The move comes as the US continues to advance its own regulatory framework for stablecoins, with some experts predicting that this could give American firms a competitive edge in the global market. ΓÇó The coalition argues that establishing clear guidelines and regulations would help to foster innovation and confidence in the UK's crypto industry.  **Takeaways**  * The UK's delay in developing a national strategy for stablecoins is likely to put the country at a disadvantage compared to its US counterparts, where regulatory clarity is advancing rapidly. * Policymakers will need to balance the need for regulatory oversight with the need to foster innovation and competition in the sector, as they consider implementing guidelines for stablecoin issuers.  **Sources** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/crypto-uk-stablecoin-strategy.html
