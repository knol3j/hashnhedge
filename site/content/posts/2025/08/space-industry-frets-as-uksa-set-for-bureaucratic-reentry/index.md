**Headline**: UK Space Agency Merges with DSIT Amid Red Tape Concerns  **Summary Meta Description**: The UK Space Agency is set to merge with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology in a bid to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. However, industry startups are worried that this move may sideline their sector.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The UK Space Agency will be absorbed into the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) ΓÇó Government claims the merger aims to cut red tape and save costs ΓÇó Industry startups express concerns about being marginalized within the merged department  **Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. While the government touts this move as a way to reduce bureaucracy, industry players are skeptical about the impact on their sector's growth. 2. The merger may be an attempt to consolidate resources, but it also risks homogenizing the unique needs and priorities of the space industry within a larger department.  **Sources:** https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/20/uk_space_agency_dsit/
