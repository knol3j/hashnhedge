Here's the news brief:  **Headline:** Ant and Termite-Eating Mammals Rarely Switch Diets  **Summary Meta Description:** A new study reveals that mammals that start eating ants and termites almost never abandon this food source, suggesting a long-term adaptation to their nutrient-poor diet. Researchers analyzed data from various species and found that only a few instances of dietary shift occurred.  **Key Points:**  * Mammals that initially consume ants and termites rarely switch to other food sources. * Data analysis revealed only 3-4% of species exhibited dietary shifts. * Species like aardvarks and pangolins maintained their ant and termite-eating habits for extended periods.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. The study highlights the remarkable adaptability of mammals in exploiting alternative food sources, which is crucial in ecosystems where primary food resources are scarce. 2. This adaptation suggests that mammalian species can adjust their diets to cope with changing environmental conditions, leading to increased resilience and persistence in the face of uncertainty.  **Sources:** https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/mammals-that-chose-ants-and-termites-as-food-almost-never-go-back/
