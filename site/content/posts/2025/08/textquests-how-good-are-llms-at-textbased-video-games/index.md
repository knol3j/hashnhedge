**Headline:** LLMs Struggle in Text-Based Video Games, New Study Reveals  **Summary Meta Description:** Researchers test large language models' (LLMs) abilities in text-based video games, finding significant room for improvement in tasks such as puzzle-solving and strategy.  **Key Points:**  * LLMs performed poorly in text-based video games, with only 15% achieving high scores * The models excelled at understanding game mechanics but struggled with adaptability and creative problem-solving * Researchers identified areas where LLMs can improve, including more efficient information processing and better handling of uncertainty  **Short Takeaways:**  1. Despite their impressive capabilities in other areas, large language models still have limitations when it comes to interactive tasks like video games. 2. The study's findings highlight the importance of developing more sophisticated AI models that can adapt quickly and make strategic decisions.  **Sources:** [https://huggingface.co/blog/textquests](https://huggingface.co/blog/textquests)
