**Headline:** GitHub Proposes Transparency Rules for AI-Generated Code Contributions  **Summary Meta Description:** The GitHub community is debating new guidelines requiring developers to disclose when they use artificial intelligence tools to generate code contributions. This move aims to enhance transparency and maintain the integrity of open-source projects.  **Key Points:**  * A proposed change to GitHub's contribution guidelines would mandate the disclosure of AI-generated code contributions. * Developers who rely on AI tooling for coding would need to indicate this in their commit messages or pull requests. * The proposal stems from concerns about accountability and the potential for AI-generated code to be misattributed or plagiarized.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Transparency is key**: Requiring developers to disclose AI-generated contributions can help maintain trust within open-source communities by acknowledging the role of automation in coding processes. 2. **Balancing innovation with accountability**: By establishing clear guidelines, GitHub aims to strike a balance between allowing innovation and minimizing potential pitfalls associated with AI-generated code.  **Sources:**  https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/8289
