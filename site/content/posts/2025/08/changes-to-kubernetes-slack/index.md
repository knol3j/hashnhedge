**Headline** Kubernetes Community to Migrate from Slack due to Downgrade  **Summary Meta Description** The Kubernetes community will be transitioning away from its custom Slack workspace, which is set to be downgraded to a standard free account on June 20th. This change will limit features and history retention, prompting the community to explore alternative platforms, including Discord.  **Key Points:**  * The Kubernetes Slack workspace will lose its special status and be downgraded to a standard free account on June 20th. * The downgrade will result in feature limitations, including reduced history retention (90 days) and app/workflow restrictions. * The community is exploring alternative platforms, with Discord being considered as a potential replacement.  **Takeaways:**  1. The Kubernetes community's Slack migration has been prompted by Salesforce's decision to no longer provide the custom enterprise account that has supported the project for over a decade. 2. While the immediate change on June 20th may seem minor, it sets in motion a larger transition that could lead to significant changes in how the community communicates and collaborates.  **Sources**  * Kubernetes Slack Migration: https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/16/changes-to-kubernetes-slack/
