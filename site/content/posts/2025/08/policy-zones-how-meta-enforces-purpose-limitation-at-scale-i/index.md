**Meta Aims to Restrict Data Use with Policy Zones**  Meta's policy zones aim to enforce purpose limitation in batch processing systems, helping to prevent data misuse. The framework sets boundaries for data usage and ensures that it is only accessed when necessary.  **Summary Meta Description** Meta introduces policy zones to control data access in batch processing systems. This approach aims to limit data use to its intended purpose, enhancing security and preventing potential misuse.  **Key Points:**  * Policy zones establish clear rules for data access and usage * Zones restrict data from being used beyond its original purpose * Framework includes automated monitoring to enforce policy adherence  **Takeaways:** Meta's effort to implement policy zones is a step towards more responsible data handling practices. However, implementing such measures at scale could be complex.  By establishing clear boundaries for data access and usage, Meta aims to prevent potential misuse and enhance the security of its systems.
