**Headline:**  Meta's Scale-Up Approach to Purpose Limitation  **Summary Meta Description:** Facebook's parent company, Meta, has developed a system to enforce purpose limitation at scale in batch processing systems. The method involves assigning policy zones to different data streams, ensuring that sensitive information is handled and shared securely.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Policy Zones are used by Meta to segment its data processing systems ΓÇó Each zone defines specific access controls and policies for handling data ΓÇó This approach enables the enforcement of purpose limitation at scale in batch processing systems  **Takeaways with Analysis:** Meta's implementation of policy zones highlights a growing trend among tech giants toward enhanced data governance. While this development demonstrates Meta's commitment to purpose limitation, it remains unclear whether such measures will be sufficient to address ongoing regulatory concerns. By segmenting its data processing systems and assigning specific access controls, Meta aims to reduce the risk of unauthorized data sharing or misuse.  **Sources:**  https://engineering.fb.com/2025/07/23/security/policy-zones-meta-purpose-limitation-batch-processing-systems/
