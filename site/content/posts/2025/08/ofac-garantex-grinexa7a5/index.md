**Headline** "OFAC Sanctions Russian Crypto Network Garantex, Relaunches as Grinex"  **Summary Meta Description** "The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has added Russian cryptocurrency network Garantex to its sanctions list. The network, which was previously sanctioned, has relaunched under a new name, Grinex, and is now using the A7A5 token. This move raises questions about legislative evasion in the crypto economy."  **Key Points:**  * OFAC has added Garantex to its sanctions list, effective August 2025 * The network was previously sanctioned in 2019 for alleged ties to Russian organized crime * Grinex has relaunched under a new name and is now using the A7A5 token * This move may indicate an attempt by Garantex to evade legislative sanctions  **Takeaways:**  1. **Legislative Evasion Concerns**: The relaunch of Garantex as Grinex raises concerns about legislative evasion in the crypto economy. This move may suggest that the network is attempting to circumvent sanctions. 2. **US Regulatory Pressure**: The addition of Garantex to OFAC's sanctions list highlights ongoing US regulatory pressure on Russian cryptocurrency networks.  **Sources** * https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/a7a5-grinex-russian-crypto-economy-ofac-sanctions-august-2025-japanese/
