**Headline** Google Cloud Publishes Guide to Building Real-Time Voice Agents with Gemini and ADK  **Summary Meta Description** Learn how to build advanced, real-time voice agents using Google's Gemini and Agent Development Kit (ADK). This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on creating conversational AI systems that can handle complex tasks and interact with users in natural language.  **Key Points**  *   The guide uses Gemini and ADK to create a real-time voice agent *   Agents need low-latency, two-way communication, real-time information retrieval, and the ability to handle complex tasks *   The foundational agent is created first, relying on pre-trained knowledge only *   Advanced agents are built by adding tools that allow access to external data and services  **Short Takeaways**  1.  Building real-time voice agents requires a combination of AI capabilities and low-latency communication protocols. 2.  Google's Gemini and ADK provide the necessary tools for developers to create advanced conversational systems.  **Sources** *   [https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/build-a-real-time-voice-agent-with-gemini-adk/](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/build-a-real-time-voice-agent-with-gemini-adk/)
