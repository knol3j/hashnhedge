title: Tracking the Cost of Quantum Factoring
---

**Quantum Computing Breakthrough Raises Cryptography Concerns**  As quantum computers approach practicality, their potential to break current encryption methods has significant implications for online security. Google's Quantum AI Lab has released a study tracking the cost of quantum factoring, highlighting the growing threat.  **Summary Meta Description:** Researchers at Google's Quantum AI Lab have been monitoring the increasing efficiency of quantum computers in breaking RSA-2048 encryption keys, sparking concerns about the long-term viability of widely used cryptographic protocols. The study provides insight into the rapidly evolving landscape of quantum computing and its potential impact on online security.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Google's researchers found that a 53-qubit quantum computer can factor large composite numbers with high probability. ΓÇó This achievement marks significant progress towards practical quantum computing, sparking concerns about the security of RSA-2048 encryption keys used in many applications. ΓÇó The study suggests that current cryptographic protocols may be vulnerable to attacks by 2026 or earlier.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The development of practical quantum computers poses a substantial risk to widely used encryption methods. As these machines become more efficient, they will be capable of breaking even the most secure encryption keys in use today. 2. While this breakthrough is concerning for online security, researchers are actively exploring new cryptographic protocols designed specifically to counteract quantum computing's potential threats.  **Sources:** http://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/tracking-cost-of-quantum-factori.html
