**Headline:** Google Reveals True Energy Footprint of AI Inference  **Summary Meta Description:** Google sheds light on the environmental impact of its AI model inference, revealing that each median Gemini App text-generation prompt consumes approximately 1.37 kW-hrs of energy, produces 0.85 kg CO2 emissions, and uses 3.5 liters of water.  **Key Findings:**  * Each median Gemini App text-generation prompt consumes around 1.37 kW-hrs of energy. * This results in approximately 0.85 kg CO2 emissions per prompt. * The process also uses about 3.5 liters of water per prompt. * Google attributes these efficiency gains to its full-stack approach, which includes custom-built hardware, optimized algorithms, and efficient model architectures.  **Industry-Wide Implications:** Google's findings aim to drive industry-wide progress toward more efficient AI development. By sharing their methodology and results, the tech giant seeks to encourage other companies to follow suit and reduce their own environmental impact.
