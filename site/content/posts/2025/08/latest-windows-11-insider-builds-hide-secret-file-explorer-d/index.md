---

**Headline:** "Windows 11 Insider Builds Hide Secret File Explorer Dark Mode"  **Summary Meta Description:** "Microsoft's latest Windows 11 insider builds include a hidden dark mode feature for File Explorer, which could finally bring consistency to the operating system's aesthetic."  **Key Points:**  * The new feature is currently hidden in insider builds and not yet enabled by default. * Despite dark mode being enabled globally, some dialog boxes remain white. * This inconsistency may be addressed with the introduction of a dedicated dark mode for File Explorer.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. Microsoft's continued efforts to refine Windows 11's user experience suggest a growing focus on consistency and visual coherence. 2. The hidden beta feature hints at an eventual rollout, potentially marking another step towards a more cohesive design language for the operating system.  **Sources:** https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/19/windows_11_insider_builds_file_explorer_dark_mode/
