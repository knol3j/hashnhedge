**Headline**: Colo Capacity Hits Record Lows  **Summary Meta Description**: A record-low vacancy rate in North American datacenters has experts warning that a significant increase in construction and deployment is needed to meet growing demand, potentially requiring up to $1 trillion in new infrastructure by 2030.  **Key Points:**  * Colocation capacity in North American datacenters has reached an all-time low. * Much of the current construction pipeline is already pre-leased. * Experts estimate that up to $1 trillion in fresh datacenter builds are needed before 2030 to meet demand.  **Short Takeaways and Analysis:**  1. The rapid growth of cloud computing and digital services has led to a surge in demand for datacenter capacity, but the industry's response has been inadequate, resulting in this record-low vacancy rate. 2. This trend highlights the need for investment and innovation in the datacenter sector to ensure that supply can keep pace with growing demand, which is expected to continue driving technological advancements.  **Sources:**  https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/19/jll_vacancy_rate/
