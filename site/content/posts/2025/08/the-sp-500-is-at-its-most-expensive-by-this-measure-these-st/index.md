Here's the news brief:  **Headline:** S&P 500 Hits Record Price, but These Stocks Defy Trend  **Summary Meta Description:** The S&P 500 has reached its most expensive levels in history based on price-to-revenue ratio, but certain companies' stocks have bucked this trend. What sets them apart?  **Key Points:**  * The S&P 500's price-to-revenue ratio is at a record high, with many companies trading above their average revenue. * Despite this, some companies' stocks are trading below their historical average revenue, defying the broader market trend. * These companies tend to be in industries that have been less affected by the pandemic or have strong growth prospects.  **Takeaways:**  1. While the S&P 500's valuation is at historic highs, there are still opportunities for investors to find undervalued companies with potential for growth. 2. The contrast between these "under-the-radar" stocks and their more expensive peers highlights the importance of fundamental analysis in investing decisions.  **Sources:** MarketWatch  Note: The line of original context is provided by the second takeaway, which highlights the importance of fundamental analysis in identifying undervalued companies amidst a historically high-valued market.
