**Headline**: "Rust-Based Server Uses Zero Syscalls, Boosts Performance"  **Summary Meta Description**: A Rust-based HTTPS server has been developed using zero syscalls, leveraging io_uring and kTLS to achieve significant performance gains. This innovative approach could revolutionize the way web servers handle network operations.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó The server uses io_uring for asynchronous I/O operations, eliminating the need for traditional syscall overhead. ΓÇó kTLS is used to offload TLS processing from the CPU, further reducing latency and increasing throughput. ΓÇó The Rust programming language enables efficient memory management and concurrency support.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis**  1. **Performance Gains**: By minimizing syscalls and leveraging io_uring and kTLS, this server demonstrates a significant boost in performance, making it an attractive solution for high-traffic web applications. 2. **Future Implications**: This development could pave the way for more efficient use of system resources, enabling developers to build even faster and more scalable web servers.  **Sources**  * https://blog.habets.se/2025/04/io-uring-ktls-and-rust-for-zero-syscall-https-server.html
