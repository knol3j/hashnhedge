**Headline** Cattle Traders Eye Friday's Report Amid Mixed Trade  **Summary Meta Description** Cattle traders are cautiously optimistic ahead of this week's crucial report, with live futures posting mixed trade and cash prices lingering. Nearbys remain relatively unchanged while deferred contracts see gains.  **Key Points:**  • Live cattle futures closed within 15 cents of their previous trading levels. • Cash trade has been sluggish this week, with some northern dressed cattle selling at $385 and live trade at $245. • The Thursday Fed Cattle Exchange online auction reported no sales on its 1,264 head offering.  **Short Takeaways:**  - **Uncertainty Ahead**: Friday's report will be a crucial indicator of market trends. A mixed reaction from traders suggests volatility could remain in the short term. - **Cash Trade Lingers**: The slow pace of cash trade this week underscores ongoing challenges in the cattle industry, with prices remaining relatively stable despite some fluctuations.  **Sources** https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cattle-traders-square-ahead-fridays-report-closing-mixed
