**Headline**: "Scientists Unravel Mystery of Cell Size"  **Summary Meta Description**: Scientists have made a breakthrough in understanding the relationship between cell size and cellular processes, discovering that cells with more volume tend to divide less frequently. This new insight could have significant implications for fields such as cancer research and tissue engineering.  **Bullet Key Points:**  ΓÇó Researchers analyzed data from over 1000 species of plants and animals ΓÇó They found a strong correlation between cell volume and division frequency ΓÇó Cells with larger volumes divided less often, while smaller cells divided more frequently  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The study's findings challenge previous assumptions about the relationship between cell size and growth patterns. 2. This discovery could have significant implications for fields such as cancer research and tissue engineering.  **Sources**: [www.asimov.press/p/cell-weight](http://www.asimov.press/p/cell-weight)
