Here is a news brief based on the provided source:  **Headline:** Yieldstreet's Real Estate Bets Leave Customers with Massive Losses  **Summary Meta Description:** A CNBC investigation reveals that Yieldstreet, a platform allowing customers to "invest like the 1%", has led some investors to suffer significant losses due to its real estate bets. The platform's investment strategy and customer agreements have come under scrutiny.  **Key Points:**  * Yieldstreet allows high-net-worth individuals to invest in real estate development projects, often with guarantees of returns. * However, some customers report receiving significantly lower payouts or no payments at all on their investments. * An investigation found that Yieldstreet's investment strategy and customer agreements may not be transparent enough. * Some experts question whether the platform's high fees and minimum investment requirements are fair to customers.  **Takeaways:**  1. The "invest like the 1%" approach, popularized by platforms like Yieldstreet, may not always deliver on its promises of high returns for customers with significant financial means. 2. Regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase as more cases of alleged mismanagement and lack of transparency come to light in the private investment industry.  **Sources:**  https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/yieldstreet-real-estate-bets-customer-losses.html
