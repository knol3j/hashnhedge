**Headline** Canada Ends Most Retaliatory Tariffs on US, Excluding Autos and Steel  **Summary Meta Description** Canada has largely lifted its retaliatory tariffs on the United States, excluding measures targeting auto and steel imports. The move follows a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that found some of Canada's tariffs were unlawful. The decision aims to de-escalate trade tensions between the two nations.  **Key Points:**  * Most Canadian tariffs imposed in response to US Section 232 measures have been dropped * Exceptions include auto and steel imports, which remain subject to retaliatory tariffs * WTO ruling found some of Canada's tariffs were unlawful, prompting the decision  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis:**  1. **Escalation Eases**: Canada's move is seen as a positive step towards easing trade tensions between the two nations. However, the exceptions for auto and steel imports suggest that underlying issues remain. 2. **Trade Tensions Persist**: The exclusion of key sectors like autos and steel may indicate that deeper trade disputes will require further negotiations to resolve.  **Sources:** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/canada-retaliatory-tariffs-trump-autos-steel.html
