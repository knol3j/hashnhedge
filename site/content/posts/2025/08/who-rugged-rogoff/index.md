Here is the rewritten news brief:  **Headline:** "Rogoff Blames 'Criminals' and Trump for Bitcoin Market Collapse"  **Summary Meta Description:** "Nouriel Roubini's rival, Nouriel Rogoff, blames criminals and Trump administration policies for Bitcoin's recent price drop. However, experts argue that the market's instability is a result of internal factors such as security vulnerabilities and lack of regulation."  **Key Points:**  * Rogoff claims that criminals are manipulating the market to drive down prices. * He also blames the Trump administration's policies for contributing to the decline. * Experts suggest that internal market factors, including security vulnerabilities and lack of regulation, are more significant contributors to the price drop.  **Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. **Security Concerns:** The recent market collapse highlights the need for robust security measures in cryptocurrency trading platforms. Rogoff's claim that "criminals" are manipulating the market may not be entirely unfounded, given the increasing reports of exchange hacks and theft. 2. **Regulatory Challenges:** The lack of clear regulations governing cryptocurrencies has led to a Wild West-like environment where vulnerabilities can be exploited. This situation calls for more stringent regulatory frameworks to ensure investor protection and stability.  **Sources:**  * https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/who-rugged-rogoff-blames-criminals-trump
