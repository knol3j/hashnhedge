**Headline** Fed's Hammack Boosts Dollar, Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Plunge  **Summary Meta Description** The Federal Reserve's speech on interest rates sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices dropping significantly as investors react to the potential for a sustained period of high interest rates.  **Key Points**  • The Fed's remarks on holding interest rates steady have boosted the US dollar, making cryptocurrencies more expensive. • Investors are reevaluating their risk appetite in response to the interest rate environment. • The speech could be followed by "cautiously hawkish" remarks from Jerome Powell tomorrow, according to Bitwise's Juan Leon.  **Takeaways**  1. The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady is sending a clear message to investors: inflation remains a top concern. This has led to a surge in the US dollar, which has put downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices. 2. As the market reacts to this new information, it's essential for investors to reevaluate their risk appetite and position themselves accordingly.  **Sources** https://decrypt.co/336271/bitcoin-ethereum-sink-feds-hammack-case-holding-interest-rates
