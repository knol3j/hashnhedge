**Headline:**  CISA Adds One New Vulnerability to Its KEV Catalog  **Summary Meta Description:** The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added one new vulnerability, CVE-2025-54948, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. This move is part of ongoing efforts to protect federal networks from active threats. The catalog serves as a living list of known vulnerabilities that pose significant risks.  **Key Points:**  * CISA has added one new vulnerability, CVE-2025-54948, Trend Micro Apex One OS Command Injection Vulnerability, to its KEV Catalog. * These types of vulnerabilities are frequent targets for malicious actors and can pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. * The catalog is a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk.  **Takeaways:**  1.  **Risk Mitigation:** Organizations should prioritize timely remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. This helps reduce exposure to cyberattacks. 2.  **Broader Impact:** Although CISA's Binding Operational Directive 22-01 primarily targets Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, all organizations are urged to adopt similar practices for enhanced security.  **Sources:** https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/08/18/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog
