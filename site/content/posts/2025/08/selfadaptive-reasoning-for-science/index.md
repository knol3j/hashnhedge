**Headline:** AI System Adapts to Scientific Inquiry  **Summary Meta Description:** A new Microsoft research paper presents a self-adaptive reasoning system that can adjust its approach to scientific inquiry based on evolving data and questions. This innovative AI model has potential applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and climate modeling.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The system uses a hybrid of symbolic and connectionist reasoning to adapt to new information. ΓÇó It can switch between different modes of reasoning depending on the context and available data. ΓÇó The self-adaptive approach allows for more efficient use of computational resources and improved accuracy in scientific inquiry.  **Takeaways:**  1. This research represents an important step towards developing AI systems that can dynamically adjust their reasoning to match the complexities of real-world problems. 2. While promising, further testing and validation are necessary to fully understand the potential applications and limitations of this technology.  **Sources:**  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/self-adaptive-reasoning-for-science/
