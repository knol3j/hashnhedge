**Headline:** Water Machine Manufacturer Founder Charged in $275 Million Fraud Scheme  **Summary Meta Description:** The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Ryan Wear, founder of Washington-based water machine manufacturer, and his companies with operating a $275 million Ponzi-like scheme between 2016 and 2022. Charges include securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The SEC alleges that Water Station Management LLC and Creative Technologies, Inc. operated two related schemes. ΓÇó Investors were promised unusually high returns on investments in water treatment systems. ΓÇó The schemes allegedly netted over $275 million in ill-gotten gains for Wear and his companies.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. This case highlights the SEC's ongoing efforts to combat large-scale financial fraud, particularly those involving complex schemes targeting vulnerable investors. 2. The use of Ponzi-like schemes by legitimate business owners demonstrates a brazen disregard for regulatory oversight and investor protections.  **Sources:**  https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-107-founder-owner-washington-based-water-machine-manufacturer-two-companies-charged-275-million-fraud
