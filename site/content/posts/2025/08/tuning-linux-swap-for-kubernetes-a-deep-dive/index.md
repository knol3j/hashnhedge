Here's a concise news brief based on the source:  **Headline:** Kubernetes NodeSwap Feature Set to Become Stable in v1.34: Expert Guide to Tuning Linux Swap for Optimal Performance  **Summary Meta Description:** As Kubernetes' NodeSwap feature prepares to graduate to stable in v1.34, experts are highlighting the importance of tuning Linux swap behavior for optimal performance and stability. This article provides a deep dive into key kernel parameters, test results, and recommendations for achieving the best balance between node stability and performance.  **Bullet Key Points:**  * Kubernetes' NodeSwap feature, set to become stable in v1.34, allows nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted. * Enabling swap is not a "turn-key" solution; careful tuning of kernel parameters is required to avoid performance degradation and masking memory leaks. * Key kernel parameters include `vm.swappiness`, `min_free_kbytes`, and `watermark_scale_factor`. * Test results demonstrate the importance of balancing node stability and performance, with optimal settings dependent on workload characteristics.  **Recommendations:**  * Set `vm.swappiness=60` as a starting point for general-purpose workloads. * Use `vm.min_free_kbytes=500000` (500MB) to give nodes a reasonable safety buffer. * Increase `watermark_scale_factor` to 2000 to create a larger window for `kswapd` to work with.  **Expert Insights:**  The article highlights the complexities of tuning Linux swap behavior for Kubernetes environments, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and benchmarking. By providing a comprehensive guide to kernel parameters and test results, this article equips readers with the knowledge to optimize their nodes' performance and stability.
