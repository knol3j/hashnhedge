title: 'Bitcoin Analysis: Why Everyone''s Wrong About the Next Bull Run'
---

Everyone's waiting for the next bull run like it's the second coming of Christ, clutching their hardware wallets and refreshing CoinGecko every thirty seconds. Here's why they're all fucked.

## The Denial Phase

You know what nobody talks about? How every single "crypto expert" on Twitter is basically a carnival fortune teller with a Tradingview subscription. They draw lines on charts like toddlers with crayons, pretending they can predict the future while their own portfolios look like crime scenes.

## The Real Pattern

Here's the pattern that actually matters:
1. Retail gets excited
2. Whales dump on their heads
3. "Diamond hands" become "ramen for dinner"
4. Repeat until poverty

## What's Actually Coming

The next bull run will happen when you've already sold everything at a loss to pay for your therapist who's helping you deal with the trauma of losing your life savings to a dog coin.

That's not financial advice. That's just life in the grey zone where hope goes to die.
