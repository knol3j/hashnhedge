The feature is built on top of the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) project, which provides a way for nodes to expose their features to the cluster. Here are some key points from the text: 1. &lt;strong>Image Compatibility&lt;/strong>: Image compatibility allows containerized applications to specify the required node features, such as kernel modules or CPU models. 2. &lt;strong>Node Feature Discovery (NFD)&lt;/strong>: NFD is a project that provides a way for nodes to expose their features to the cluster. It uses a discovery mechanism to find available features on each node. 3. &lt;strong>Compatibility Artifact&lt;/strong>: A compatibility artifact is an OCI artifact that contains metadata about the image&amp;rsquo;s requirements based on node features. 4. &lt;strong>Client Implementation&lt;/strong>: The client tool allows users to validate whether a node meets the image&amp;rsquo;s requirements using the &lt;code>nfd compat validate-node&lt;/code> command. 5. &lt;strong>Validation Report&lt;/strong>: The client generates a JSON report indicating whether the node meets the image&amp;rsquo;s requirements. The text also provides an example of how to define image compatibility metadata, attach it to an image using ORAS, and validate image compatibility using the NFD client tool. Overall, the implementation of image compatibility in Kubernetes aims to improve the reliability and performance of specialized containerized applications by allowing them to define and validate host OS requirements more efficiently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Navigating Failures in Pods With Devices</title><link>https://hashnhedge.com/posts/2025/08/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 18:34:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hashnhedge.com/posts/2025/08/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/</guid><description>&lt;p>The article discusses the challenges of handling failures in Kubernetes environments, particularly for AI/ML workloads. The authors identify three main failure modes: 1. &lt;strong>Device Failure&lt;/strong>: This occurs when a device, such as a GPU or network interface, fails to function correctly. 2. &lt;strong>Container Code Failure&lt;/strong>: This happens when a container&amp;rsquo;s code executes incorrectly, causing the pod to fail. 3. &lt;strong>Device Degradation&lt;/strong>: In this scenario, a device may still be functional but is experiencing performance degradation, which can impact the workload. The authors propose several solutions and recommendations for handling these failure modes: &lt;strong>Device Failure&lt;/strong> * Improve plugin reliability through best practices in development and deployment * Integrate device failures into Pod Failure Policy * Node-local retry policies to enable pod failure policies for Pods with restartPolicy=OnFailure &lt;strong>Container Code Failure&lt;/strong> * Implement cheaper error handling and recovery, such as: 	+ Reusing pre-allocated resources (e.g., reusing Pods by restarting containers in-place) 	+ Node local restart of containers instead of rescheduling 	+ Snapshotting support 	+ Rescheduling prioritizing the same node to save on image pulls &lt;strong>Device Degradation&lt;/strong> * There is limited work done in this area, and more research is needed * Hardware vendors and cloud providers are expected to develop solutions for device degradation The authors also highlight several ongoing projects and discussions within the Kubernetes community that aim to address these failure modes. &lt;strong>Takeaways:&lt;/strong> 1. Device failures can have a significant impact on AI/ML workloads. 2. Kubernetes needs to provide better support for handling device failures. 3. Container code failures are already well-handled by Kubernetes, but there&amp;rsquo;s room for improvement in terms of cost and efficiency. 4. Device degradation is an emerging area that requires more research and development. &lt;strong>Recommendations:&lt;/strong> 1. Join the Kubernetes community (SIG Node) to contribute to ongoing discussions and shape the future of device failure handling. 2. Provide feedback on patterns used in device degradation scenarios, as this space is expected to evolve rapidly. 3. Participate in ongoing projects and discussions that aim to address device failure modes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Postquantum cryptography in kubernetes</title><link>https://hashnhedge.com/posts/2025/08/postquantum-cryptography-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 18:34:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hashnhedge.com/posts/2025/08/postquantum-cryptography-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Headline:&lt;/strong> Kubernetes Adopting Post-Quantum Cryptography by Default &lt;strong>Summary Meta Description:&lt;/strong> Kubernetes has quietly begun adopting post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for secure connections, leveraging Go&amp;rsquo;s default support for hybrid PQC key exchange mechanisms. This development comes as the industry prepares for a future where quantum computers can break current cryptographic standards. &lt;strong>Key Points:&lt;/strong> * Kubernetes v1.33 uses Go 1.24 by default, which enables support for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in TLS connections. * The &lt;code>X25519MLKEM768&lt;/code> hybrid scheme is the most widely supported PQC key exchange mechanism, combining classical and quantum-resistant algorithms. * PQC digital signatures are still in earlier stages of development and adoption due to larger keys and signature sizes, as well as performance concerns. &lt;strong>Takeaways:&lt;/strong> 1. &lt;strong>Quantum-Safe Kubernetes:&lt;/strong> Kubernetes has made significant strides in adopting post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for secure connections by default. This move is a proactive step towards securing the platform against potential quantum computer attacks. 2. &lt;strong>Awareness and Considerations:&lt;/strong> As PQC adoption increases, awareness of potential pitfalls such as Go version mismatches leading to downgrades and issues with Client Hello packet sizes becomes crucial.
