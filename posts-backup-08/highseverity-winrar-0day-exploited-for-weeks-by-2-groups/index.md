**Headline** WinRAR Zero-Day Exploit Widespread for Weeks  **Summary Meta Description** A high-severity vulnerability in the widely used WinRAR software has been exploited by two groups, potentially compromising thousands of computers worldwide. The zero-day exploit was identified after a report from cybersecurity firm, and its impact is still being assessed.  **Bullet Key Points**  * A high-severity vulnerability in WinRAR allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. * Two separate groups have been exploiting the 0-day, with one group targeting users via email phishing attacks. * The exploit was only discovered after a report from cybersecurity firm, indicating it went unnoticed for weeks.  **Short Takeaways**  * This incident highlights the ongoing threat posed by zero-day exploits, which can be exploited even before vendors are aware of them. It emphasizes the need for regular software updates and vigilant users to prevent such attacks. * The fact that two groups were exploiting this vulnerability suggests a larger ecosystem of attackers taking advantage of known vulnerabilities, underscoring the importance of proactive security measures.  **Sources** https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/high-severity-winrar-0-day-exploited-for-weeks-by-2-groups/
