**Headline:** "Hong Kong Firm Ming Shing Invests $483M in Bitcoin"  **Summary Meta Description:** "The price of bitcoin remains above $113,000 as Hong Kong's Ming Shing Group announces a massive investment in the cryptocurrency. The move is being seen as a significant vote of confidence in the digital asset's future value."  **Key Points:**   Ming Shing Group has invested $483 million in bitcoin, citing its potential for long-term growth.  The investment brings the company's total exposure to bitcoin to over 10% of its assets.  The price of bitcoin remains steady at above $113,000, following a significant surge in recent weeks.  **Takeaways:**  1. This substantial investment from a Hong Kong-based firm adds credibility to the idea that institutional investors are increasingly turning their attention to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. However, it's essential to note that this is still a relatively small player in the global market. 2. The sustained price of bitcoin above $113,000 suggests a growing confidence in its long-term value among major investors. Nevertheless, regulatory hurdles and market volatility will likely continue to influence the cryptocurrency's trajectory.  **Sources:**  * https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-price-stays-above-113000-as-hongkongs-ming-shing-announces-to-buy-483-million-in-bitcoin
