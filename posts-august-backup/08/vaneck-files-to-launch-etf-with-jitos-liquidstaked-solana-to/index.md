**Headline** VanEck Seeks Approval for Solana-Based ETF with Liquid-Staked Tokens  **Summary Meta Description** Financial services firm VanEck has filed to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to Jito's liquid-staked Solana tokens, following a recent regulatory determination that such arrangements are not securities transactions. The move could pave the way for increased institutional investment in the Solana ecosystem.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó VanEck's ETF filing marks a significant development in the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) within the Solana ecosystem. ΓÇó Jito's liquid-staked tokens enable users to "stake" their SOL holdings without having to hold onto them, potentially increasing liquidity and accessibility. ΓÇó The regulatory clarification on liquid staking is expected to attract more institutional investors into DeFi.  **Short Takeaways**  1. **Regulatory Clarity**: Regulatory agencies' determination that liquid staking is not a securities transaction has created a clear pathway for VanEck's ETF launch. This development should boost investor confidence in the Solana ecosystem. 2. **Increased Accessibility**: The introduction of an ETF tied to Jito's liquid-staked tokens could make it easier for institutional investors and mainstream users to participate in DeFi, driving growth within the Solana network.  **Sources** * "VanEck Files to Launch ETF With Jito's Liquid-Staked Solana Tokens" by Decrypt (https://decrypt.co/336514/vaneck-files-launch-solana-etf-jito-liquid-staked-tokens)
