**Headline:** Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen Surge Amid Global Trade Uncertainty  **Summary Meta Description:** The Swiss franc and Japanese yen have seen significant gains as investors flock to safe-haven currencies amid growing concerns over global trade tensions. The rise of these currencies is attributed to a combination of factors, including the US-China tariff dispute and the potential for further protectionist policies.  **Key Points:**  * The Swiss franc has risen by 1% against the dollar, reaching its strongest level in two months. * The Japanese yen has also strengthened, gaining 0.5% against the greenback. * Investors are seeking safe-haven assets as global trade uncertainty increases. * The rise of these currencies is also linked to the declining US dollar.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Safe-haven currencies are benefiting from increased investor caution**: As trade tensions escalate and protectionist policies gain traction, investors are turning to traditional safe-havens like the Swiss franc and Japanese yen as a way to hedge against potential losses. 2. **Global economic uncertainty is taking its toll on emerging markets**: The strengthening of safe-haven currencies highlights the growing concern among investors about the impact of trade tensions on global growth and emerging market economies.  **Sources:**  https://www.wsj.com/articles/safe-haven-currencies-strengthen-amid-fears-over-global-tariffs-9964e17a?mod=rss_markets_main
