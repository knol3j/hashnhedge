**Headline** UK Crypto Firms Warn of Stablecoin Gap with US  **Summary Meta Description** The UK's crypto industry is pushing for a national stablecoin strategy to avoid falling behind the US, which has already established clear guidelines. The move comes as the global market grows, and companies face uncertainty in navigating regulatory environments.  **Key Points:**  * Crypto firms are urging the UK government to create a national stablecoin strategy * The US has already established clear guidelines for stablecoins * A national strategy could help UK firms avoid regulatory uncertainty * Stablecoins are increasingly used as a low-risk investment and payment tool  **Takeaways:**  1. **Regulatory clarity**: A national stablecoin strategy would provide much-needed clarity for crypto firms operating in the UK, allowing them to better navigate complex regulations. 2. **Global competitiveness**: By failing to establish clear guidelines, the UK risks falling behind the US and other countries that have already developed robust regulatory frameworks for stablecoins.  **Sources:** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/crypto-uk-stablecoin-strategy.html
