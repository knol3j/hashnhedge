**Headline** Coinbase CEO Sees $1M Bitcoin by 2030  **Summary Meta Description** In a recent interview, Coinbase's Brian Armstrong predicted that the value of one Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. This forecast is based on Bitcoin's historical growth rate and its potential adoption as a widely accepted form of payment.  **Key Points**  * Armstrong cited Bitcoin's 12-year growth curve as a basis for his prediction * He noted that, if the cryptocurrency's price follows this trend, it could reach $1 million by 2030 * The Coinbase CEO also emphasized the importance of institutional investment in driving up demand and prices  **Takeaways**  * **Historical Trends**: Armstrong's prediction is based on Bitcoin's past growth rate, which has shown significant increases over time. If this trend continues, a value of $1 million by 2030 may not be unrealistic. * **Adoption as Payment Method**: For the price of one Bitcoin to reach $1 million, widespread adoption and use as a widely accepted form of payment would likely need to occur.  **Sources** Cryptoslate: https://cryptoslate.com/coinbases-brian-armstrong-envisions-1-million-bitcoin-by-2030/
