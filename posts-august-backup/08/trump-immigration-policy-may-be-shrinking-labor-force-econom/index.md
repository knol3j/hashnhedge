**Headline** Trump Immigration Policy May Reduce Labor Force, Economists Warn  **Summary Meta Description** A new study suggests that the Trump administration's immigration policies may have a significant impact on the US labor force. According to economists, the reduction in immigrant workers could lead to a shrinking workforce and potential economic consequences.  **Bullet Key Points**   A recent study estimates that the number of working-age immigrants has decreased by 1.3 million since 2017.  Economists warn that this decline may contribute to a shrinking labor force, potentially affecting economic growth.  The Trump administration's policies, including stricter visa requirements and increased deportations, are cited as contributing factors.  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis**  * The study highlights the potential consequences of restrictive immigration policies on the US economy. A shrinking labor force could lead to reduced productivity, decreased consumer spending, and slower economic growth. * However, it's also worth noting that some argue that stricter immigration policies can help alleviate wage pressures and protect American workers' jobs.  **Sources** CNBC - "Trump immigration policy may be shrinking labor force, economists say" (https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/trump-immigration-policy-labor-force.html)
