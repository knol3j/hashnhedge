**Headline:** RBC Sees Value in Overvalued Gold  **Summary Meta Description:** Royal Bank of Canada's analysts argue that gold's unique properties defy conventional investment models, making it an attractive long-term bet despite its current high price. They point to its store-of-value function, safe-haven appeal, and lack of correlation with traditional assets as key factors driving their bullish stance.  **Key Points:**  * RBC considers gold an "overvalued asset" yet still sees value in it * Analysts highlight gold's unique properties that defy standard financial modeling * Gold serves as a store-of-value and safe-haven asset, making it attractive during times of uncertainty * Its lack of correlation with traditional assets makes it a valuable addition to investment portfolios  **Takeaways:**  1. RBC's analysts are taking an unconventional approach by advocating for gold despite its current high price, suggesting that they believe its unique properties will continue to drive demand and value. 2. The bank's bullish stance on gold may be seen as a contrarian view, but it highlights the importance of considering non-traditional assets in investment portfolios, especially during times of market volatility.  **Sources:** MarketWatch - "The Golden Anomaly: Here's Why RBC Is Bullish On What It Calls an 'Overvalued Asset'" https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-golden-anomaly-heres-why-rbc-is-bullish-on-what-it-calls-an-overvalued-asset-c2d6f255?mod=mw_rss_topstories
