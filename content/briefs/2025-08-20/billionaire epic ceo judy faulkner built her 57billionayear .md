ΓÇó Despite her success, Faulkner says not getting an MBA was a "really good thing" for her career. ΓÇó She attributes her entrepreneurial skills to learning by doing and taking calculated risks. ΓÇó Faulkner's unconventional approach contrasts with other CEOs, such as Tim Cook and Mary Barra, who hold MBAs.  **Takeaways:**  1. The traditional path of getting an MBA may not be the only or even the best route for entrepreneurs seeking success in business. Judy Faulkner's story highlights the importance of experiential learning and adapting to changing circumstances. 2.
