**Headline:** Employers Catch on to RTO Policy Evasion  **Summary Meta Description:** As remote work policies evolve, employers are becoming more adept at detecting and addressing instances of employees exploiting their flexibility. New research suggests that the lines between legitimate flexible work arrangements and policy abuse are blurring.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Employers are increasingly monitoring employee work patterns to prevent RTO (right-to-operate) policy evasion. ΓÇó A study found that 62% of employers reported detecting at least one instance of employees exploiting their flexible work policies in the past year. ΓÇó The most common forms of policy abuse include working during non-work hours, taking extended breaks, and using company resources for personal activities.  **Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. As remote work policies continue to evolve, the need for clear guidelines and enforcement mechanisms becomes more pressing. Employers must strike a balance between offering flexible arrangements and preventing policy abuse. 2. The increasing ability of employers to monitor employee activity underscores the importance of implementing effective monitoring and reporting systems to detect and address instances of policy evasion.  **Sources:** https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/its-getting-harder-to-skirt-rto-policies-without-employers-noticing/
