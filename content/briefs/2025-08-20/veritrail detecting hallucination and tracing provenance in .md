**Headline** Microsoft Develops VeriTrail to Prevent "Hallucinations" in AI Workflows  **Summary Meta Description** Researchers at Microsoft have introduced VeriTrail, a tool that detects and prevents AI "hallucinations" in multi-step workflows. By tracing the origin of incorrect information, VeriTail aims to enhance AI reliability and trustworthiness.  **Key Points**  * VeriTrail identifies instances of AI-generated errors or inaccuracies in complex workflows * The tool uses a combination of machine learning and data provenance techniques to detect and correct "hallucinations" * Microsoft researchers claim VeriTrail can improve AI accuracy by up to 90% in certain applications  **Takeaways**  1. **AI Reliability Gap**: VeriTrail highlights the growing concern around AI reliability, particularly in multi-step workflows where errors can compound quickly. 2. **Provenance and Trust**: By tracing the origin of incorrect information, VeriTrail demonstrates the importance of data provenance in maintaining trust in AI systems.  **Sources** * Microsoft Research Blog: "VeriTrail: Detecting hallucination and tracing provenance in multi-step AI workflows" (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/veritrail-detecting-hallucination-and-tracing-provenance-in-multi-step-ai-workflows/)
