**Headline:** "Code Review Methods Need an Overhaul"  **Summary Meta Description:** A recent article from TigerBeetle argues that traditional code review methods are inefficient and often ineffective, leading to missed bugs and delayed projects. The author proposes new approaches to improve the process.  **Bullet Key Points:**  * Current code review methods can lead to a backlog of pending reviews, causing delays in project completion * Traditional peer review processes often focus on style and convention rather than actual bug detection * Some companies are implementing more efficient review models, such as continuous integration and automated testing  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis:**  1. The current code review system is plagued by inefficiencies, resulting in wasted time and resources. By streamlining the process, teams can focus on high-priority tasks. 2. As technology continues to evolve, so must our approach to code review. Adopting new methods that prioritize bug detection and prevention will yield better results for developers.  **Sources:**  * TigerBeetle - https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-08-04-code-review-can-be-better/
