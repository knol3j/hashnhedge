**Headline:** "Russia's Shadow Crypto Market Evades Sanctions"  **Summary Meta Description:** "Recent reports reveal that Russia has created a complex network of crypto assets and exchanges to evade US sanctions, including the Garantex rebrand, Grinex, and A7A5 token. These entities have enabled Russians to continue using cryptocurrency despite economic restrictions."  **Key Points:**  * The Garantex exchange was rebranded as "G2" in 2024, allowing it to continue operating despite US sanctions. * Grinex, a Russian-based crypto platform, has been linked to the country's shadow economy and has continued to operate despite being added to OFAC's list. * A7A5 is a ruble-backed token that has allowed Russians to use cryptocurrency for domestic transactions while avoiding international sanctions.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. Russia's reliance on cryptocurrency as an alternative to traditional financial systems has enabled the country to continue operating in the global economy despite economic restrictions. This raises questions about the effectiveness of US sanctions and their impact on the Russian economy. 2. The creation of complex networks of crypto assets and exchanges highlights the adaptability and resilience of Russia's shadow economy, which continues to evolve and find new ways to circumvent international regulations.  **Sources:**  https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/a7a5-grinex-russian-crypto-economy-ofac-sanctions-august-2025/
