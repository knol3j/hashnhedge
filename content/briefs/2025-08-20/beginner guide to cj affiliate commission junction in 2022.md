CJ offers advanced tracking, management, and payment options for advertisers, making it a popular choice in the industry. 3.  For publishers, CJ provides promotional tools like banners, links, and social media integration to help boost their site's visibility. 4.  While CJ has its own set of features, some users may find that the platform has a bit of a learning curve, especially for new affiliates. 5.  One of the biggest benefits of CJ is its vast network of advertisers and publishers, making it easier for users to find relevant programs and increase their earning potential.
