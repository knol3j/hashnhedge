**Headline** Google Tracks Rising Costs of Quantum Computing Threat to Cryptography  **Summary Meta Description** "Google's latest research reveals the increasing cost-effectiveness of quantum computers in factoring large numbers, a breakthrough that could compromise cryptographic systems. As computing power grows, so does the urgency for post-quantum cryptography."  **Key Points:**  * Google researchers have been tracking the growth in quantum computer performance and its impact on cryptography. * Quantum computers can now factor 2048-bit RSA numbers within 2^64 operations, a significant improvement from previous estimates. * The cost of building a quantum computer capable of breaking certain encryption algorithms is decreasing rapidly.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Quantum computing's growing power**: As quantum computers improve in performance and decrease in cost, the threat to cryptographic systems becomes more pressing. Experts warn that post-quantum cryptography solutions are urgently needed. 2. **Cryptographic urgency**: The increasing cost-effectiveness of quantum computers means that certain encryption algorithms will soon be vulnerable to attack. This highlights the need for organizations to migrate to post-quantum cryptography before it's too late.  **Sources:** http://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/tracking-cost-of-quantum-factori.html
