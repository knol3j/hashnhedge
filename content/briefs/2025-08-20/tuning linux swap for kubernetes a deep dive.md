**Headline** Tuning Linux Swap for Kubernetes: A Deep Dive into Optimal Configuration  **Summary Meta Description** Discover how to effectively tune Linux swap configuration for optimal performance in Kubernetes clusters. Learn about key kernel parameters, test results, and best practices for balancing stability and resource utilization.  **Key Points**  * The NodeSwap feature allows swap usage on Linux nodes, improving resource utilization and reducing out-of-memory (OOM) kills. * Enabling swap requires careful tuning of Linux kernel parameters to avoid performance degradation and interference with Kubelet's eviction logic. * Key kernel parameters for swap tuning include `vm.swappiness`, `vm.min_free_kbytes`, and `vm.watermark_scale_factor`. * Test results demonstrate the impact of different configurations on workload performance, swap utilization, and node stability.  **Recommendations**  * Set `vm.swappiness` to 60 (default) or a lower value for workloads sensitive to I/O latency. * Increase `vm.min_free_kbytes` to 500MB (2-3% of total node memory) to provide a safety buffer against OOM kills. * Adjust `vm.watermark_scale_factor` to create a larger swapping window and prevent OOM kills during sudden memory allocation spikes.  **Risks and Considerations**  * Swapping can mask memory leaks in applications, making it harder to diagnose root causes. * Improper tuning can lead to performance degradation, eviction disabling, or premature OOM kills.  **Kubernetes Context**  * The kernel watermarks and kubelet eviction threshold create a series of memory pressure zones on a node. * Adjusting these parameters is essential for configuring Kubernetes-managed evictions before OOM kills occur.
