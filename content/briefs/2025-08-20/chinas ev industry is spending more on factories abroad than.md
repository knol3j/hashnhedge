**Headline:** China's EV Industry Shifts Abroad  **Summary Meta Description:** China's electric vehicle industry is investing more in foreign factories than domestically for the first time, a shift driven by rising labor costs and supply chain concerns. The trend highlights the growing global competition in the EV sector.  **Bullet Key Points:**  ΓÇó China's EV manufacturers are investing heavily abroad to avoid high domestic labor costs. ΓÇó Labor costs in China have risen 15% this year alone, exacerbating the industry's shift towards foreign investment. ΓÇó Overseas investments are expected to accelerate as companies seek lower production costs and better supply chain management.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The trend marks a significant shift for China's EV industry, which has traditionally been driven by domestic demand. As global competition intensifies, Chinese manufacturers are adapting their strategies to remain competitive. 2. Rising labor costs in China, combined with increasing competition from other countries, have prompted the industry to invest abroad and seek lower production costs.  **Sources:**  https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/chinas-electric-car-industry-invests-more-overseas-than-at-home.html
