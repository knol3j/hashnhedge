This tactic underscores the growing sophistication of cyber threats, as attackers find new ways to evade detection using seemingly innocuous file types like SVG. 2. Online security measures must adapt to these evolving threats, emphasizing the importance of robust browser security and regular software updates.  **Sources:**  https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/adult-sites-use-malicious-svg-files-to-rack-up-likes-on-facebook/
