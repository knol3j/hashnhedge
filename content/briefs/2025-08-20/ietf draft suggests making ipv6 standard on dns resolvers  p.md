**Headline:** IETF Draft Proposes IPv6 Default on DNS Resolvers  **Summary Meta Description:** A draft from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) suggests making IPv6 the default standard for Domain Name System (DNS) resolvers, which could lead to a decline in the use of IPv4. The proposal aims to modernize the internet's addressing system and potentially accelerate the demise of IPv4.  **Key Points:**  * The IETF draft proposes defining support for IPv6 as a best practice for DNS resolver operators * Adoption of this standard could lead to increased adoption of IPv6 and decreased reliance on IPv4 * One researcher hopes that IPv4 usage will decline as a result of the proposed change  **Short Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. **IPv6 Adoption Accelerated:** The proposal's goal of making IPv6 the default standard for DNS resolvers could lead to a significant increase in IPv6 adoption, as more networks and devices would be configured to use it by default. 2. **IPv4's Decline Imminent?:** As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, the need for IPv4 addresses may decrease, potentially leading to a decline in demand and prices for IPv4 addresses.  **Sources:** https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/20/ietf_dnsop_3901bis_ipv4_ipv6/
