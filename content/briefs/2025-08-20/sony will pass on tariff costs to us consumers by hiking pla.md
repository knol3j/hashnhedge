**Headline:** Sony Raises PlayStation 5 Prices Amid Tariff Costs  **Summary Meta Description:** Sony will pass on the costs of US tariffs to consumers by increasing the price of its PlayStation 5 console. The move comes as the company navigates a trade war between the US and China. Details on the price hike and affected regions are still unclear.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Sony has announced plans to raise the prices of its PlayStation 5 consoles due to increased costs associated with US tariffs. ΓÇó The tariff costs will be passed on directly to consumers, rather than absorbed by the company. ΓÇó The exact price increase is not yet disclosed, and it's uncertain which regions will be affected.  **Short Takeaways:**  * Sony's decision to pass on tariff costs highlights the economic impact of trade tensions between the US and China. As companies face increased expenses, they often opt to raise prices for consumers rather than absorb the losses. * The price hike may further strain consumer wallets in an already competitive gaming market, potentially affecting sales and market share.  **Sources:** https://fortune.com/2025/08/20/sony-playstation-5-price-increase-tariff-costs/
