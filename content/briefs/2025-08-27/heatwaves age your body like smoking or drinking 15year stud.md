**Headline:** Heatwaves Accelerate Aging  **Summary Meta Description:** A 15-year study of over 25,000 individuals has found that repeated exposure to extreme heat can accelerate biological aging at a rate comparable to smoking or excessive drinking. Manual workers were disproportionately affected.  **Key Points:**  * Repeated exposure to extreme heat accelerates biological aging. * The impact is similar in magnitude to that of smoking and excessive drinking. * Manual workers experienced triple the effect of accelerated aging due to heat exposure. * The study involved 25,000 participants over a period of 15 years. * Researchers found correlations between heatwaves and accelerated telomere shortening.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **The Study's Findings Have Widespread Implications:** While the research focuses on health outcomes related to aging, it highlights the need for policymakers to address climate change as a public health issue. 2. **Vulnerability of Manual Workers Highlighted:** The study underscores the disproportionate impact of heatwaves on individuals with physically demanding jobs, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and protections.  **Sources:** Decrypt.co - Heatwaves Age Your Body Like Smoking or Drinking, 15-Year Study Finds https://decrypt.co/337107/heatwaves-age-your-body-like-smoking-drinking-15-year-study-finds
