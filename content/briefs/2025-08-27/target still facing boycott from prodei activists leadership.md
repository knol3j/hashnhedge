**Headline:** Target Faces Continued Boycott Pressure Despite Leadership Change  **Summary Meta Description:** Pro-DEI activists continue to boycott Target despite the company's new CEO, raising questions about whether leadership change alone can address ongoing concerns. The debate centers on whether a cultural shift is necessary to satisfy critics.  **Key Points:**  * Target has been facing a boycott from pro-DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) activists since last year. * The company's new CEO, John Leipold, has not yet addressed the concerns of the activist group. * Proponents argue that leadership change is insufficient without a broader cultural shift within the organization.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Leadership Change Alone is Insufficient**: Pro-DEI activists emphasize that merely replacing executives will not address deeper cultural issues driving their boycott. 2. **Cultural Shift Necessary for Reconciliation**: Critics argue that Target must undergo a genuine transformation to regain the trust of those who have called for the boycott.  **Sources:**  https://fortune.com/2025/08/27/target-boycott-dei-new-ceo-leadership-change/
