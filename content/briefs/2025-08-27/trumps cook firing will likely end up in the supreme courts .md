The move has sparked questions about First Amendment rights and executive branch power.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó Trump's decision to fire his press secretary has set off alarm bells among free speech advocates.

ΓÇó Similar cases have been taken up by the high court in recent years, with implications for government transparency and accountability.  **Takeaways**  * This development underscores the ongoing tension between the White House's desire for control over information and the press corps' right to access and report on public events.
