**Headline** Wealthy Americans Flee to Europe to Avoid Tariffs on Luxury Items  **Summary Meta Description** Wealthy Americans are taking advantage of their passports to escape tariffs on luxury goods in the US by traveling to Europe. The practice, which involves temporarily relocating to avoid taxes, is being used by some individuals and companies to circumvent trade restrictions.  **Key Points:**  * Wealthy individuals and companies are using temporary relocations to Europe to avoid paying tariffs on luxury goods * This tactic involves staying in Europe for a short period, typically 183 days or less, to meet the IRS's tax residency test * The practice is being used by some to circumvent trade restrictions imposed by the US-China trade war and EU-US tariffs  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The use of temporary relocations to avoid taxes highlights the complexities of global trade regulations and the incentives for individuals and companies to exploit loopholes. 2. This trend also underscores the growing wealth disparity in the US, where some individuals can afford to travel internationally to minimize their tax burdens.  **Sources** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/wealthy-travel-to-europe-to-dodge-tariffs-on-luxury-goods.html
