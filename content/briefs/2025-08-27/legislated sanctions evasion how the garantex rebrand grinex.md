**Headline**: Russia's Shadow Crypto Economy Evades Sanctions  **Summary Meta Description**: Chainalysis analysis reveals how Russian entities have exploited loopholes in US sanctions to maintain a thriving crypto economy. Grinex, A7A5, and Garantex rebranding allowed evasion of financial restrictions, highlighting vulnerabilities in the current regulatory framework.  **Key Points**:  ΓÇó In August 2025, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added several Russian entities to its sanctions list. ΓÇó Despite these measures, Grinex continued operations, while A7A5 introduced a ruble-backed token to bypass US restrictions. ΓÇó Chainalysis found that Garantex rebranded itself as a legitimate business, allowing it to maintain connections with sanctioned parties.  **Short Takeaways**:  1. The recent additions to the OFAC sanctions list have not effectively curtailed Russia's crypto activities, highlighting the need for more robust regulations. 2. The adaptability of Russian entities in exploiting regulatory loopholes underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and updating of sanctions lists.  **Sources**: https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/a7a5-grinex-russian-crypto-economy-ofac-sanctions-august-2025/
