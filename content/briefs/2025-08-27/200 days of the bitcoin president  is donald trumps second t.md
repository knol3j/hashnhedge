Here is the rewritten news brief:  **Headline:** "200 Days Under Trump: Bitcoin's Wild Ride"  **Summary Meta Description:** "The first 200 days of Donald Trump's second term have brought significant developments for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regulation. From a mixed bag of policies to ongoing court battles, we break down the key takeaways from this pivotal period."  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The administration has largely maintained a hands-off approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. ΓÇó A major victory for crypto advocates came with the dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the legitimacy of Bitcoin as a commodity. ΓÇó Trump's nominee for Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair, Kristin Johnson, may bring a more crypto-friendly stance.  **Takeaways:**  * While some in the industry have welcomed the lack of aggressive regulation, others see it as a missed opportunity to establish clear guidelines and protections for investors. * The ongoing court battles surrounding cryptocurrency taxation and securities law may yet provide clarity on these contentious issues.  **Sources:** https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/recapping-200-days-trump-president
