Here is the news brief:  **Headline:** AI May Not Replace Jobs, But Change How They're Done  **Summary Meta Description:** New research from Microsoft suggests that while AI may displace some jobs, it's more likely to change the way others are performed. Experts weigh in on the implications for workers and industries.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The study found that 40% of jobs have a high likelihood of being automated, but also identified many tasks within those jobs that humans are uniquely suited to perform. ΓÇó AI is more likely to augment human capabilities than replace them, with 60% of tasks requiring both human and machine intelligence. ΓÇó Researchers argue that education and training programs should focus on developing skills that complement AI rather than trying to compete with it.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The debate around AI's impact on jobs has become more nuanced, highlighting the need for workers and industries to adapt to new technologies. As Microsoft researcher notes, "AI is not a zero-sum game, where one entity wins and another loses." 2. This research underscores the importance of rethinking education and training programs to focus on developing skills that are complementary to AI, rather than trying to compete with it. By doing so, workers can thrive in an increasingly automated economy.  **Sources:** Microsoft Research Blog, "Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations" - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/applicability-vs-job-displacement-further-notes-on-our-recent-research-on-ai-and-occupations/
