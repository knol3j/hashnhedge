**Headline**: Kubernetes Gets Quantum-Safe by Default with PQC Key Exchange  **Summary Meta Description**: The latest Kubernetes release (v1.33) includes support for hybrid post-quantum cryptography, making it a significant step towards quantum-safe connections. This development has implications for the wider industry and highlights the need for awareness of potential pitfalls.  **Key Points:**  * Kubernetes v1.33 supports hybrid post-quantum key exchange by default * The use of Go 1.24 enables the standardized <code>ML-KEM</code> algorithm, also known as <code>X25519MLKEM768</code> * This development has significant implications for the wider industry and highlights the importance of staying informed about post-quantum cryptography  **Takeaways:**  1. **Quantum-Safe Kubernetes**: The latest release of Kubernetes (v1.33) includes support for hybrid post-quantum key exchange, making it a significant step towards quantum-safe connections. 2. **Pitfalls Ahead**: However, there are potential pitfalls to be aware of, such as Go version mismatches leading to downgrades and issues with Client Hello packet sizes.  **Sources:**  * [Kubernetes Blog: Post-Quantum Cryptography in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/18/pqc-in-k8s/)
