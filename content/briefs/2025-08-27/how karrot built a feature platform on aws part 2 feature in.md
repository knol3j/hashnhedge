**Headline** Karrot's Real-Time Feature Ingestion on AWS  **Summary Meta Description** Karrot's feature platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a three-component system that includes real-time and batch ingestion pipelines to manage features in an online store. This article explores the technical approaches taken by Karrot to ensure stable operation.  **Key Points**  *   The stream ingestion pipeline collects features in real-time using AWS Kinesis Data Firehose. *   The batch ingestion pipeline processes data in batches using AWS S3 and AWS Glue. *   Karrot's feature platform uses a combination of AWS services for scalable and fault-tolerant operation.  **Takeaways with Analysis**  1.  **Real-time vs Batch Ingestion**: Karrot's use of both real-time and batch ingestion pipelines demonstrates the importance of considering different data processing strategies depending on the specific requirements of an application. 2.  **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**: The combination of AWS services used by Karrot highlights the need for a robust architecture that can scale with high traffic and handle failures to ensure reliable operation.  **Sources**  *   https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/how-karrot-built-a-feature-platform-on-aws-part-2-feature-ingestion/
