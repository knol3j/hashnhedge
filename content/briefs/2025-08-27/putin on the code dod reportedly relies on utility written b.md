**Headline:** "Russian Developer's Code Used in DoD Projects, Raises Security Concerns"  **Summary Meta Description:** A widely used Node.js utility called Fast-glob has been adopted by over 30 Department of Defense projects and thousands of public projects. However, its sole maintainer is a Russian developer with ties to Yandex, sparking security concerns.  **Key Points:**  * The Fast-glob utility is used in over 30 Department of Defense projects. * Its sole maintainer is identified as a Russian developer living in Russia. * Online profiles suggest the developer works for Yandex, a Russian tech giant. * Fast-glob has thousands of public project dependencies worldwide.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Dependence on foreign code**: The widespread use of Fast-glob by US government agencies raises questions about dependence on potentially vulnerable or malicious foreign code. 2. **Security risks**: Having a sole maintainer with ties to a Russian tech company like Yandex could introduce security risks, especially in sensitive DoD projects.  **Sources:**  https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/27/popular_nodejs_utility_used_by/
