**Headline** Roth Conversions Could Cut Trump's SALT Deductions  **Summary Meta Description** President Trump's $40,000 "SALT" deduction may be reduced for high earners due to Roth conversions. A new proposal suggests that income from Roth conversions could be subject to the SALT limitation, potentially affecting individuals with large retirement accounts.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó The proposal would apply to income earned from Roth conversions in 2025 and later. ΓÇó The change aims to reduce tax benefits for high-income earners who convert traditional IRAs to Roths. ΓÇó Estimated impact: $40,000 or more reduction in SALT deductions for affected individuals.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis**  1. **Tax code complexity increases**: This proposal adds another layer of complexity to the already convoluted tax code, potentially leading to increased administrative costs and confusion among taxpayers. 2. **Wealthy individuals may be disproportionately affected**: The change could have significant implications for high-net-worth individuals who rely on Roth conversions as a tax-planning strategy.  **Sources** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/roth-conversions-trump-salt-deduction.html
