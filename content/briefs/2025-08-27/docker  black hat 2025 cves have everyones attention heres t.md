**Headline:** Docker Tackles Security at Black Hat 2025  **Summary Meta Description:**  At Black Hat 2025, Docker emphasized the importance of securing software supply chains in the face of growing vulnerabilities. The company outlined steps for developers to address emerging concerns and strengthen their defenses against potential threats.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Docker highlighted the need for a more proactive approach to vulnerability management. ΓÇó The company proposed implementing secure-by-design principles throughout software development pipelines. ΓÇó Docker emphasized the importance of collaboration between developers, security experts, and operators in addressing supply chain risks. ΓÇó The conference focused on real-world examples of successful vulnerability mitigation strategies. ΓÇó A shift towards open-source security tools was also discussed.  **Short Takeaways:**  1.  **The Rise of Proactive Security**: As vulnerability detection improves, it's becoming increasingly clear that a reactive approach to security is no longer sufficient. Docker's emphasis on proactive measures like secure-by-design principles and collaboration between stakeholders reflects this shift. 2.  **Supply Chain Risk Management Becomes Paramount**: The growing number of vulnerabilities has highlighted the need for robust supply chain risk management strategies. Docker's initiatives at Black Hat 2025 underscored this imperative, encouraging developers to integrate security into every stage of software development.  **Sources:**  https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-black-hat-2025-secure-software-supply-chain/
