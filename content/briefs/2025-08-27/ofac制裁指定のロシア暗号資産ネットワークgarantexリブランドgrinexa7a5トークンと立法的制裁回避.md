**Headline**: OFAC Adds Russian Crypto Asset Network to Sanctions List  **Summary Meta Description**: The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has added the A7A5 token, previously linked to Grinex and now rebranded as Garantex, to its sanctions list. This move aims to combat money laundering and terrorist financing in Russia's crypto economy.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó The OFAC has designated A7A5, a cryptocurrency token formerly associated with Grinex, as a sanctioned asset. ΓÇó The decision marks the latest step in efforts to restrict Russian access to the global financial system through digital assets. ΓÇó Garantex, once connected to the A7A5 token, now appears to have rebranded and is not directly linked to the sanctions.  **Takeaways**  * The addition of A7A5 to OFAC's sanctions list highlights growing concern over Russia's use of cryptocurrency for illicit activities. * As global authorities tighten regulations on digital assets, exchanges and wallet services must ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws to avoid reputational damage and potential penalties.  **Sources**  https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/a7a5-grinex-russian-crypto-economy-ofac-sanctions-august-2025-japanese/
