**Headline:** NASA's PowerPoint Problem: Lessons from the Columbia Disaster  **Summary Meta Description:** The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003 highlighted a critical issue with NASA's reliance on Microsoft PowerPoint for complex engineering and safety briefings. An investigation revealed that the overuse of presentation software contributed to the tragedy, sparking a review of the agency's communication protocols.  **Key Points:**  * The Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, when the space shuttle broke apart during re-entry due to a piece of foam insulation striking the shuttle's protective tiles. * An investigation by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) found that inadequate communication and a reliance on PowerPoint presentations hindered the identification of potential safety issues. * The CAIB report highlighted the use of PowerPoint as a factor in the disaster, stating that the software was often used to condense complex information into brief presentations, rather than facilitating in-depth discussions.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **PowerPoint pitfalls:** The Columbia disaster serves as a cautionary tale about the limitations of presentation software in conveying critical information and facilitating meaningful discussion. 2. **Communication breakdowns:** The incident underscores the importance of clear communication and collaboration in high-stakes environments, such as space exploration.  **Sources:** https://mcdreeamiemusings.com/blog/2019/4/13/gsux1h6bnt8lqjd7w2t2mtvfg81uhx
