**Headline**: Breathwork and Music Induce Altered States of Consciousness  **Summary Meta Description**: A new study investigates the effects of combining breathwork with music on consciousness, revealing altered states in participants. Researchers used electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor brain activity during the sessions.  **Key Points**  * Participants reported higher levels of relaxation and decreased anxiety after sessions. * Brain wave patterns indicated alpha and theta state transitions, associated with meditation and deep relaxation. * EEG data showed synchronized brain activity between individuals, suggesting a shared altered state experience.  **Takeaways**  1. The study's findings suggest that breathwork combined with music can induce a collective altered state of consciousness, characterized by decreased anxiety and increased relaxation. 2. This research contributes to the growing understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying breathwork and its potential therapeutic applications, including stress relief and meditation practices.  **Sources**:  https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329411
