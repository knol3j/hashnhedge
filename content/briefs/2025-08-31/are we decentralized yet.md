**Headline:** Ethereum's Layer 2 Rollup Adoption Grows  **Summary Meta Description:** Explore the current state of decentralization in the blockchain space, particularly with regards to Ethereum's layer 2 rollups. Despite significant growth, challenges remain for widespread adoption and true decentralization.  **Key Points:**  * Ethereum's layer 2 rollups have gained traction, but still account for a small fraction of total transactions. * Adoption is driven by the need for scalability solutions, not necessarily a desire for decentralized architecture. * Rollups' reliance on centralized infrastructure raises questions about their long-term decentralized nature. * Several large-scale rollup projects are underway, but their impact on overall decentralization remains unclear.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. While layer 2 rollups have improved scalability, they may not be a significant step towards true decentralization. 2. The decentralized vs. centralized nature of these solutions highlights the ongoing trade-offs in blockchain development.  **Sources:**  https://arewedecentralizedyet.online/
