**Headline:** EU Regulations Choke Small Businesses, Say Experts  **Summary Meta Description:** European Union regulations have been criticized for stifling business growth and innovation. A recent report highlights how over-regulation is affecting small businesses and entrepreneurs across the continent.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The EU's regulatory burden has increased significantly since 2020. ΓÇó Smaller companies struggle to comply with complex regulations, hindering their growth prospects. ΓÇó Over-regulation hinders innovation, leading to a loss of competitiveness in global markets.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Regulatory Burden**: While regulation aims to protect consumers and businesses, the current EU regulatory framework may be overly broad and burdensome for smaller companies. This can limit business expansion and hinder economic growth. 2. **Innovation Stifled**: Over-regulation leads to a risk-averse business environment where companies are less likely to innovate or invest in new technologies. This can result in lost opportunities and reduced competitiveness.  **Sources:** https://about.fb.com/news/2025/08/how-eu-over-regulation-is-stifling-business-growth-and-innovation/
