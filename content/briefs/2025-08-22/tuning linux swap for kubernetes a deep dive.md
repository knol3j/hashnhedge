**Headline** "Kubernetes Tunes Linux Swap for Better Performance"  **Summary Meta Description** "Learn how Kubernetes' NodeSwap feature allows Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, improving resource utilization and reducing out-of-memory (OOM) kills. Discover key kernel parameters for swap tuning and understand the risks of enabling swap in Kubernetes."  **Bullet Key Points**  * Kubernetes' NodeSwap feature enables Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory * Swap usage can improve resource utilization and reduce OOM kills, but requires careful tuning * Critical kernel parameters include `vm.swappiness`, `vm.min_free_kbytes`, and `vm.watermark_scale_factor` * Misconfiguration of these parameters can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet's eviction mechanism  **Risks and Recommendations**  * Enabling swap in Kubernetes comes with risks, including performance degradation, masking memory leaks, and disabling evictions * Proper tuning is essential to ensure kubelet's eviction mechanism remains effective * A recommended starting point for Linux nodes with swap enabled includes `vm.swappiness=60`, `vm.min_free_kbytes=500000` (500MB), and `vm.watermark_scale_factor=2000`  **Kubernetes Context**  * Kubernetes managed evictions occur before OOM kills when properly configured * The eviction-threshold parameters need to be adjusted to configure effective swap utilization  **Conclusion**  Enabling swap in Kubernetes is a powerful tool, but requires careful tuning of critical kernel parameters. By understanding the risks and recommendations outlined above, administrators can ensure that their cluster runs smoothly and efficiently.
