**Headline:**  Russia's Shadow Crypto Economy Evades Sanctions Amid Rebranding and Tokenization Efforts  **Summary Meta Description:** A recent investigation by Chainalysis reveals how Russia's shadow crypto economy has adapted to evade US sanctions through rebranding and tokenization, highlighting the evolving tactics of sanctioned entities such as Garantex and Grinex.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The report identifies 14 instances of sanctioned Russian entities rebranding or creating new tokens to circumvent OFAC restrictions. ΓÇó Garantex, previously sanctioned for allegedly facilitating illicit transactions, has rebranded as a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange. ΓÇó Grinex, another sanctioned entity, has launched its own token, A7A5, pegged to the value of the Russian ruble. ΓÇó The findings suggest that these tactics allow sanctioned entities to maintain operations and evade detection.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Adaptation is key:** Sanctioned entities are continually adapting their strategies to evade regulations, highlighting the need for regulators to stay ahead of evolving tactics. 2. **Tokenization as a tool:** The use of tokens such as A7A5 may be seen as an attempt to legitimize illicit activities or obscure the true purpose and ownership of assets.  **Sources:** https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/a7a5-grinex-russian-crypto-economy-ofac-sanctions-august-2025/
