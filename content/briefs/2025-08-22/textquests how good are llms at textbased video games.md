**Headline:** "LLMs Struggle with Text-Based Game Complexity"  **Summary Meta Description:** Researchers from Hugging Face's TextQuests investigate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text-based video games, revealing a gap between their ability to process and act upon game information.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó LLMs show strength in processing and understanding game rules, objectives, and feedback. ΓÇó However, they struggle with complex decision-making, often opting for suboptimal choices. ΓÇó The models' reliance on heuristics leads to a "lack of true exploration" in the games tested.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. While LLMs demonstrate impressive language processing capabilities, their performance in text-based games highlights limitations in reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty. 2. This research has implications for the development of AI systems capable of interacting with dynamic, complex environments like video games ΓÇô and potentially real-world applications.  **Sources:**  - https://huggingface.co/blog/textquests
