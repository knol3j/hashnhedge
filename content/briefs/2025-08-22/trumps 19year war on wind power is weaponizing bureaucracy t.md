**Headline:** Trump's Wind Power Crackdown Continues Amid Criticism  **Summary Meta Description:** President Trump's administration has been criticized for its efforts to hinder wind power development, with critics arguing that the tactics are "weaponizing bureaucracy" and undermining American energy production. A new report examines the 19-year history of these policies, which go beyond tax credits and include regulations on land use and wildlife habitats.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The Trump administration has implemented several policies aimed at limiting wind power development, including a moratorium on offshore wind farms. ΓÇó Critics argue that these policies are driven by a "weaponized bureaucracy" designed to favor fossil fuels over renewable energy sources. ΓÇó The 19-year history of these policies shows a consistent effort to undermine American energy production and hinder the growth of the wind industry.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Regulatory Overreach**: Critics argue that the Trump administration's efforts to limit wind power development are driven by a desire to favor fossil fuels, rather than a genuine concern for environmental or economic issues. 2. **Long-Term Impact**: The 19-year history of these policies suggests a sustained effort to undermine American energy production and hinder the growth of the wind industry, which could have long-term consequences for the country's energy landscape.  **Sources:**  https://fortune.com/2025/08/22/trump-war-wind-way-beyond-tax-credits/
