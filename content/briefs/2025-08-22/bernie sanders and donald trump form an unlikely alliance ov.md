**Headline:** Sanders, Trump Unite on Chipmaker Subsidies  **Summary Meta Description:** In a rare bipartisan effort, Senators Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have formed an unlikely alliance to provide billions in subsidies for the US chipmaking industry. The legislation aims to boost domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The Senate bill allocates $10 billion in subsidies for Intel and other major chipmakers. ΓÇó The funds will be used to support research, development, and production of cutting-edge semiconductors. ΓÇó Proponents argue the subsidies are necessary to counter China's growing dominance in the global chip market.  **Takeaways:**  1. This unlikely alliance highlights the bipartisan efforts to address pressing economic issues, such as the US' reliance on foreign chip suppliers. The collaboration demonstrates that lawmakers can put aside their differences when faced with a critical national interest. 2. Critics argue that the subsidies could lead to a new wave of corporate welfare, raising questions about the long-term implications for the industry and taxpayers.  **Sources:** https://fortune.com/2025/08/21/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-intel-chips/
