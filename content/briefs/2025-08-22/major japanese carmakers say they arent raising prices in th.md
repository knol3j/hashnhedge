**Headline:** Japanese Car Makers Deny Passing Tariffs to US Consumers  **Summary Meta Description:** Major Japanese car manufacturers assert that they will not increase prices in the US market due to ongoing tariffs, despite concerns from industry experts. The companies' statements come amidst rising trade tensions between Japan and the US.  **Bullet Key Points:**  * Toyota, Honda, and Nissan confirm they won't raise prices due to tariffs. * Industry analysts express skepticism about the manufacturers' claims. * Tariffs on Japanese autos have been in place since 2018, with no end in sight. * The companies attribute their decision to "cost reductions" and "pricing strategies."  **Short Takeaways:**  1. While Japanese car makers may not pass tariffs directly onto US consumers, other costs such as transportation or logistics might increase, ultimately affecting prices. 2. Industry experts question the manufacturers' claims, suggesting that tariff costs are likely being absorbed elsewhere in the supply chain.  **Sources:** CNBC - https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/japan-auto-majors-say-they-arent-passing-tariff-costs-to-us-consumers.html
