**Headline** GPT-5 Rollout Marred by Delays and Technical Issues  **Summary Meta Description** The rollout of GPT-5, the latest iteration of OpenAI's language model, has been plagued by delays, technical issues, and controversy surrounding its capabilities. The model's promise of human-like conversation has yet to be fully realized, sparking debate about its limitations and potential risks.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó The GPT-5 rollout was initially expected in June but has been pushed back several times due to technical difficulties. ΓÇó Some users have reported experiencing errors, slow loading times, and inconsistent performance with the model. ΓÇó Critics argue that GPT-5's capabilities are overhyped and that it falls short of expectations in terms of understanding and generating coherent text.  **Takeaways**  * The GPT-5 rollout serves as a reminder that even cutting-edge AI technologies can be prone to errors and technical issues, which can undermine user trust. * As AI models like GPT-5 become increasingly integrated into various industries, it's essential for developers and policymakers to prioritize robust testing, validation, and oversight to ensure their reliability and safety.  **Sources** https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-gpt-5-rollout-has-been-a-big-mess
