**Headline:** Ceres May Have Been Habitable for Microbes Billion Years Ago  **Summary Meta Description:** Scientists suggest that the dwarf planet Ceres had a warm internal ocean about 2 billion years ago, potentially making it habitable for microbes. This finding has implications for understanding the early history of our solar system and the origins of life.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Dwarf planet Ceres' icy surface may have hidden a warm internal ocean. ΓÇó Radioactive decay is believed to have produced this warmth. ΓÇó The environment could have supported microbial life around 2 billion years ago. ΓÇó This discovery sheds light on the early history of our solar system and its potential for supporting life.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Habitable environments are not exclusive to planets with liquid surface water**. Ceres' internal ocean highlights that habitability can be complex and multifaceted, with various factors contributing to an environment's suitability for life. 2. **The early solar system was more conducive to life than previously thought**. Discoveries like this one underscore the possibility of microbial life existing on other bodies in our solar system, expanding our understanding of its origins.  **Sources:** https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/22/ceres_habitable_period/
