**Headline:** DHS Allocates $100M+ for Community Cybersecurity Upgrades  **Meta Description:** The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has launched a funding initiative to bolster community cybersecurity, providing over $100 million in support for local governments and critical infrastructure. This move aims to strengthen the resilience of communities against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will distribute the funds through various programs, including grants and cooperative agreements. ΓÇó Eligible recipients include local governments, schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure organizations. ΓÇó The funding is intended to support a range of cybersecurity initiatives, from vulnerability assessments to incident response planning.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Community-focused approach**: By targeting community-level cybersecurity upgrades, the DHS aims to create a more robust national defense against cyber threats. This approach acknowledges that local organizations often serve as critical infrastructure and are therefore vulnerable targets. 2. **Long-term investment**: While the initial funding allocation is significant, the program's long-term impact will depend on sustained support from Congress and continued collaboration between federal agencies and community stakeholders.  **Sources:**  * [https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/dhs-launches-over-100-million-funding-strengthen-communities-cyber-defenses](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/dhs-launches-over-100-million-funding-strengthen-communities-cyber-defenses)
