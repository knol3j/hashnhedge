**Headline** IBM and NASA Collaborate on AI Model for Predicting Space Weather  **Summary Meta Description** Researchers from IBM and NASA have developed an open-source AI model, called Surya, to predict space weather events that can impact satellites, spacecraft, and even terrestrial power grids. The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze solar activity and provide early alerts for potential disruptions.  **Key Points**  * The Surya system is designed to detect and predict space weather events caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections. * The AI model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from NASA's Space Weather Prediction Center and other sources. * The open-source system promises early alerts for potential disruptions, enabling preventive measures to be taken.  **Takeaways**  1. This collaboration highlights the increasing importance of space weather prediction in protecting critical infrastructure and preventing costly disruptions. 2. The development of an open-source AI model like Surya demonstrates a commitment to sharing knowledge and expertise in the field of space weather research.  **Sources** * https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/22/nasa_ibm_surya_model/  In developing this AI model, IBM and NASA are taking a crucial step towards mitigating the impacts of space weather on global infrastructure. As space-based technologies become increasingly vital to our daily lives, the need for accurate predictions and early alerts becomes more pressing. The Surya system's open-source nature also highlights the collaborative spirit driving innovation in this field.
