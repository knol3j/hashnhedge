**Headline:** Banks Must Leverage AI to Boost Financial Inclusion  **Summary Meta Description:** A leading expert argues that banks can use artificial intelligence to serve underserved communities and build a more equitable financial system. By leveraging AI, banks can provide affordable services, identify hidden opportunities, and reduce transaction costs.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The current banking system disproportionately favors the affluent, leaving many without access to basic financial services. ΓÇó AI can help bridge this gap by providing data-driven insights and automating processes. ΓÇó Banks can use AI to identify underserved communities and develop targeted products and services. ΓÇó By doing so, banks can contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on reducing poverty and promoting inclusive economic growth.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Rethinking traditional banking models**: The current system is not designed to serve everyone equally. AI can help banks adapt their services to meet the needs of underserved communities. 2. **A path to financial inclusivity**: By leveraging AI, banks can create a more equitable financial system that provides affordable and accessible services to all.  **Sources:**  https://fortune.com/asia/2025/08/23/banks-leverage-ai-financial-inclusion-sopnendu-mohanty/
