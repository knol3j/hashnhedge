Their statements offer insight into the scrutiny surrounding her nomination.  **Key Points**  * Current Fed officials have declined to comment directly on the investigation, citing the ongoing probe. * Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen expressed confidence in the investigation process and its ability to handle sensitive matters. * A former Fed official familiar with the matter stated that Cook's nomination was "not without controversy" from the start.  **Short Takeaways**  1. The investigation into Governor Lisa Cook highlights the high level of scrutiny surrounding Fed officials' financial dealings, reflecting a growing focus on ethics in government appointments. 2.
