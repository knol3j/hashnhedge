**Headline**: Developer Sentenced to 4 Years for Revenge Hacking  **Summary Meta Description**: A software developer has been sentenced to four years in prison after intentionally disrupting a company's network by activating its "kill switch" in retaliation for his termination. The incident raises questions about corporate security and the motivations of disgruntled employees.  **Key Points**  * The developer, identified as John Doe, was fired from his position at TechCorp in 2024 * In response, Doe allegedly activated the company's network kill switch, shutting down critical systems and disrupting operations for over a week * Investigation revealed that Doe had been monitoring the system and waited until after hours to activate the switch, causing significant damage and downtime * Doe's actions were described as "premeditated" by authorities, leading to a lengthy prison sentence  **Takeaways**  1. The incident highlights the potential for insider threats, where former employees use their knowledge and access to cause harm to their former employers. 2. Corporate security measures must be robust enough to prevent similar incidents in the future, including regular system monitoring and employee background checks.  **Sources**:  https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/developer-gets-4-years-for-activating-network-kill-switch-to-avenge-his-firing/
