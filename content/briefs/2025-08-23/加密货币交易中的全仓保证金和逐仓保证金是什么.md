**Headline** What's the Difference Between Full-Collateral Margin and Isolated Margin on BitMEX?  **Summary Meta Description** Understand the basics of margin types on BitMEX, a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. Learn about full-collateral margin and isolated margin, their differences, and how they work.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó **Full-Collateral Margin**: Uses the entire account balance as collateral, allowing for larger positions but also increasing potential losses. ΓÇó **Isolated Margin**: Deducts a fixed amount of funds from the account to use as collateral, limiting exposure and risk. ΓÇó Both types have their own fees and requirements.  **Takeaways with Analysis**  1. **Risk Management**: Isolated margin offers a safer alternative for traders who want to limit their potential losses, making it suitable for those new to derivatives trading or seeking to manage risk more effectively. 2. **Trading Strategy**: Full-collateral margin is ideal for experienced traders who understand the risks and can handle larger positions, but it requires careful management to avoid significant losses.  **Sources**  * BitMEX Blog: "Margin Types on BitMEX" - https://blog.bitmex.com/margin-types-bitmex-2/
