**Headline:** Meta Details "Policy Zones" for Enforcing Purpose Limitation in Batch Processing Systems  **Summary Meta Description:** Meta's latest effort to ensure user data is used only for intended purposes involves the implementation of "policy zones" in batch processing systems. This innovation aims to limit data use and promote transparency.  **Key Points:**  *   Meta has developed a system called "Policy Zones" to enforce purpose limitation on user data in batch processing. *   These policy zones act as virtual containers, allowing for granular control over data access and usage. *   The system is designed to scale with Meta's growing data sets and processing demands.  **Short Takeaways:**  1.  **Purpose Limitation Made Easier:** By implementing "Policy Zones," Meta is making it easier to enforce purpose limitation on user data, which is a critical component of modern data protection regulations. 2.  **Scaling Data Control:** The scalability of the system is crucial for large-scale platforms like Meta's, where data processing and storage demands are massive.  **Sources:** https://engineering.fb.com/2025/07/23/security/policy-zones-meta-purpose-limitation-batch-processing-systems/
