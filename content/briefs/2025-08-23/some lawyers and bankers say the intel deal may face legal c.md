**Headline** Intel Deal Faces Potential Legal Hurdles  **Summary Meta Description** The Intel deal may face challenges as lawyers and bankers question whether the CHIPS Act allows the US government to convert grants into equity. The controversy surrounds the $50 billion agreement between Intel and the US government, which provides tax credits and other incentives for chip manufacturing in the United States.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó Lawyers and bankers are raising concerns about the legality of converting grants into equity under the CHIPS Act. ΓÇó The act provides tax credits and other incentives for chip manufacturing in the US, but its language may not explicitly allow grant-to-equity conversions. ΓÇó Intel's deal with the US government includes $50 billion in funding, with a significant portion expected to come from converted grants.  **Takeaways**  1. **Uncertainty Surrounds Grant Conversions**: The CHIPS Act's ambiguity on grant conversions may create a hurdle for the Intel deal, which relies heavily on this funding mechanism. 2. **Potential Domino Effect**: If the grant conversion is deemed unlawful, it could set a precedent for future government-private sector partnerships, making them more complicated and costly.  **Sources** http://www.techmeme.com/250823/p12#a250823p12 (New York Times)
