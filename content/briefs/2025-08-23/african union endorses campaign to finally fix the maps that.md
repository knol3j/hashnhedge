**Headline:** AU Backs Campaign to Correct Africa's Understated Map Size  **Summary Meta Description:** The African Union has endorsed a campaign aimed at accurately representing the continent's size on maps, which have historically been distorted by using the Mercator projection. This move seeks to correct the widespread underestimation of Africa's land area and promote geographical awareness.  **Key Points:**  * The African Union has officially backed a campaign to reform map projections that have long understated the continent's size. * The Mercator projection, widely used in cartography, exaggerates the sizes of countries near the poles while reducing those closer to the equator. * Africa's land area is approximately 30.3 million square kilometers, yet its representation on maps often appears smaller compared to Greenland.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Correcting Geographical Misconceptions:** By endorsing this campaign, the African Union acknowledges the significance of accurate map representations in promoting geographical awareness and dispelling misconceptions about Africa's size. 2. **Implications for Global Understanding:** This move could have broader implications for global understanding, potentially influencing how countries perceive their place within the world and informing policy decisions on issues like economic development and resource allocation.  **Sources:** https://fortune.com/2025/08/23/africa-map-mercator-projection-greenland-projection/
