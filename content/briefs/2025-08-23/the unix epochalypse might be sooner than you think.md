**Headline:** Unix Epoch Crunch Looms in 2037  **Summary Meta Description:** The National Museum of Computing has uncovered a critical bug that could bring down Unix-based systems when the clock strikes midnight on January 19, 2038. The "Year 2038 problem" or "Unix Epochalypse" threatens widespread disruptions as ancient code fails to account for future date calculations.  **Bullet Key Points:**  ΓÇó The National Museum of Computing has identified a critical bug in an ancient Unix system. ΓÇó The issue arises from the way dates are calculated, leading to a potential crash on January 19, 2038. ΓÇó This problem is commonly referred to as the "Year 2038 problem" or "Unix Epochalypse."  **Takeaways with Light Analysis:**  1. The discovery highlights the fragility of legacy systems and underscores the importance of timely maintenance and upgrades. 2. As more devices and systems rely on Unix-based code, the potential impact of the "Unix Epochalypse" could be far-reaching.  **Sources:**  https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/23/the_unix_epochalypse_might_be/
