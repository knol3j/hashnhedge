**Headline** Karrot's Feature Ingestion Platform on AWS  **Summary Meta Description** Learn how Karrot built a feature platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that consists of three main components: feature serving, stream ingestion pipeline, and batch ingestion pipeline. This post covers the real-time and batch ingestion process into an online store.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó Karrot's feature platform collects features in real-time using a stream ingestion pipeline. ΓÇó The platform also ingests features in batches through a batch ingestion pipeline. ΓÇó Technical approaches are described for ensuring stable operation of the ingestion processes.  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis**  1. **Real-Time Ingestion**: Karrot's use of a stream ingestion pipeline allows for real-time collection and processing of feature data, enabling timely decision-making and updates in their online store. 2. **Scalability**: By separating the ingestion process into real-time and batch components, Karrot can scale its platform more efficiently to handle varying levels of traffic and data input.  **Sources** https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/how-karrot-built-a-feature-platform-on-aws-part-2-feature-ingestion/
