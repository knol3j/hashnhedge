**Headline**: WinRAR Zero-Day Exploit Exposed  **Summary Meta Description**: A high-severity vulnerability in the popular file archiver software WinRAR has been exploited by two separate groups for weeks, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems.  **Key Points**  * The zero-day exploit affects WinRAR versions 6.01 through 6.11 and earlier. * Two distinct threat actors have been observed exploiting the vulnerability since July 2025. * Exploitation can lead to remote code execution (RCE) and potentially allow attackers to install malware or escalate privileges.  **Takeaways**  1. **Widespread Exposure**: The exploit's persistence over several weeks highlights the risk of relying on outdated software, underscoring the need for timely updates and security patches. 2. **Threat Actor Sophistication**: The fact that two separate groups are exploiting this vulnerability suggests a level of sophistication among attackers, who may be targeting vulnerable systems for long-term access.  **Sources**  * [https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/high-severity-winrar-0-day-exploited-for-weeks-by-2-groups](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/high-severity-winrar-0-day-exploited-for-weeks-by-2-groups)
