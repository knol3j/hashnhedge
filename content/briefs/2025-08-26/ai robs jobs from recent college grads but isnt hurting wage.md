**Headline** AI Jobs Disappear for Recent College Grads, Study Finds  **Summary Meta Description** A Stanford study reveals that machine-learning models are disproportionately affecting entry-level job prospects for recent college graduates, leading to a 13% decline in employment rates compared to other occupations. This shift is not reflected in wage stagnation, however.  **Key Points**  * Machine-learning models are automating away some entry-level roles * Workers aged 22-25 in AI-exposed occupations saw a 13% relative decline in employment * The study focuses on jobs like software development, data analysis, and writing * Wages for recent college graduates have not been significantly impacted by the job displacement  **Short Takeaways**  1. While AI is expected to augment workforces, its current impact on entry-level jobs is more nuanced than initially thought. 2. Policymakers and educators may need to reassess their approaches to preparing students for a rapidly changing job market.  **Sources** https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/ai_hurts_recent_college_grads_jobs/
