Here's the rewritten news brief:  **Headline**: Euro Officials Torn on Digital Euro Blockchain Choice  **Summary Meta Description**: The European Union's pursuit of a digital euro is facing a critical decision: whether to utilize public blockchain platforms like Ethereum or Solana, raising concerns about monetary sovereignty and security risks.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Europe's push for a digital euro is gaining momentum, but policymakers are divided on the choice of blockchain platform. ΓÇó Ethereum and Solana, two prominent public blockchains, are being considered as potential hosts for the digital euro. ΓÇó The decision raises concerns about monetary sovereignty, as the EU may be reliant on external platforms.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Monetary Sovereignty at Stake**: By using a public blockchain like Ethereum or Solana, the EU would cede control over its financial infrastructure to an external entity, potentially undermining its monetary sovereignty. 2. **Security Risks Abound**: The use of public blockchains also raises concerns about security risks, including potential hacking vulnerabilities and data breaches.  **Sources:**  https://decrypt.co/336892/digital-euro-ethereum-solana-europe-monetary-sovereignty
