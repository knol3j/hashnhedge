**Headline:** NTP Struggles to Maintain Accuracy on Linux Systems  **Summary Meta Description:** A recent study highlights the challenges of maintaining accurate time synchronization using Network Time Protocol (NTP) on Linux systems. Despite efforts to improve accuracy, significant errors persist due to limitations in clock discipline and system load.  **Bullet Key Points:**  * NTP struggles to maintain accurate time on Linux systems, particularly under heavy loads or with high-latency networks. * Clock discipline algorithms are insufficient for compensating for large errors and maintaining synchronization. * System load, network latency, and other factors contribute to the degradation of NTP accuracy.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. **NTP limitations persist**: Despite efforts to improve time synchronization, the fundamental limitations of NTP on Linux systems remain a challenge. This underscores the need for alternative solutions or enhancements to existing protocols. 2. **System-level optimization necessary**: To address the issue, system administrators and developers must consider optimizing system load, network configuration, and clock discipline algorithms to minimize errors and maintain accurate time synchronization.  **Sources:**  * Scott Stafford's blog post "The Limits of NTP Accuracy on Linux" (https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/19/ntp-limits/) provides an in-depth analysis of the challenges facing NTP on Linux systems.
