Here is the news brief:  **Headline:** Powell's Dovish Tone Boosts Ethereum to New Heights  **Summary Meta Description:** Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent comments have sparked a rally in cryptocurrency markets, with Ethereum surpassing previous all-time highs. The price of ETH has surged past $4,800, fueled by optimism over the Fed's accommodative monetary policy.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Ethereum (ETH) has reached new heights, surpassing its previous record high. ΓÇó The surge is attributed to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's dovish comments on inflation and interest rates. ΓÇó Markets are interpreting Powell's remarks as a sign of continued monetary accommodation, boosting investor sentiment. ΓÇó Cryptocurrency prices have seen significant gains in recent days, with ETH rising over 10% in the past week.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The rally in Ethereum is largely driven by the perception that the Fed will maintain a dovish stance, leading to low interest rates and inflation expectations. This has boosted investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. 2. While Powell's comments have been seen as bullish for cryptocurrency markets, some analysts caution that this optimism may be short-lived if the Fed's actual policy actions diverge from market expectations.  **Sources:**  https://blog.bitmex.com/dovish-powell-ethereum-all-time-highs-ru/
