Here's the news brief based on the source:  **Headline:** HongShan Invests Only a Quarter of $9B Fund in 2022  **Summary Meta Description:** HongShan, formerly Sequoia China, has reportedly invested only about a quarter of its ~$9 billion fund raised last year. The firm is looking to expand beyond China for deals, according to sources.  **Key Points:**  * HongShan, a venture capital firm, raised approximately $9 billion in 2022. * According to sources, the firm has invested only around $2-3 billion of that amount so far. * HongShan is increasingly looking to invest outside of China for deals. * The firm's slow investment pace may be due to market conditions or a shift in focus.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Investment Pause:** HongShan's slower-than-expected investment pace suggests the firm may be taking a more cautious approach or reassessing its strategy, potentially due to changing market conditions. 2. **Global Reach:** The firm's growing interest in deals outside of China highlights the increasingly global nature of venture capital and private equity investments.  **Sources:** The Information: "HongShan Invests Only a Quarter of $9B Fund in 2022" (http://www.techmeme.com/250826/p40#a250826p40)
