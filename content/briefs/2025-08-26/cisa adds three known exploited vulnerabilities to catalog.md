**Headline**:  CISA Adds Three Exploited Vulnerabilities to Catalog  **Summary Meta Description:** "CISA has added three vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. The newly added vulnerabilities include Citrix Session Recording Deserialization of Untrusted Data and Git Link Following issues. While these additions are primarily aimed at Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies, CISA urges all organizations to prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice."  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Three new vulnerabilities have been added to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog due to evidence of active exploitation. ΓÇó The newly added vulnerabilities include Citrix Session Recording Deserialization of Untrusted Data and Git Link Following issues. ΓÇó Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date.  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis:**  1. **Prioritize Remediation**: CISA's addition of new vulnerabilities to its catalog highlights the importance of timely remediation for all organizations, not just those in the FCEB. 2. **Cybersecurity Risks**: The newly added vulnerabilities underscore the persistent risks posed by known exploited vulnerabilities and emphasize the need for robust vulnerability management practices.  **Sources:** https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/08/25/cisa-adds-three-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
