**Headline:** Tesla Tests Self-Driving Cars in Boring Co. Tunnels  **Summary Meta Description:** Tesla is testing its self-driving cars in the Boring Company's tunnels in Las Vegas, but a Convention Center executive cautions that full autonomy remains a distant goal.  **Key Points:**  * Tesla is conducting tests of its self-driving capabilities in the Boring Company's tunnel system * The tests are part of an effort to refine and improve autonomous driving technology * Full autonomy for Tesla vehicles still seems a ways off, according to a Convention Center executive  **Takeaways with Light Analysis:**  1. While testing is underway in Las Vegas, it appears that achieving full autonomy remains a significant challenge for the electric vehicle manufacturer. 2. The fact that testing is taking place in controlled environments like the Boring Company's tunnels suggests that Tesla is making progress towards its goal of developing more advanced autonomous driving capabilities.  **Sources:** https://fortune.com/2025/08/26/tesla-self-driving-cars-testing-boring-co-tunnels-las-vegas/ This development highlights the ongoing efforts of companies like Tesla to advance autonomous driving technology, and underscores the complexities involved in achieving full autonomy.
