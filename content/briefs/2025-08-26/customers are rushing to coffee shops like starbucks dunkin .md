**Headline**: Pumpkin Spice Lattes Boost Coffee Shop Traffic by 24%  **Summary Meta Description**: The "halo effect" of pumpkin spice lattes is driving a surge in foot traffic at coffee shops like Starbucks and Dunkin', with some locations seeing a 24% increase, analysts say.  **Key Points:**  * Starbucks sees a 24% spike in foot traffic due to the popularity of pumpkin spice lattes (PSLs) * The "halo effect" refers to the increased sales of other menu items when PSLs are offered * Analysts attribute the surge in foot traffic to the excitement around PSL season * Some locations report a significant increase in sales, with one location seeing an 11% increase in total revenue  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The seasonal popularity of pumpkin spice lattes is driving customer traffic to coffee shops, even if they don't intend to buy the PSL itself. This highlights the importance of seasonal offerings in boosting business. 2. While the "halo effect" is often associated with increased sales of related items, it's also drawing new customers into stores who may not have visited otherwise.  **Sources:**  * MarketWatch: "Customers are rushing to coffee shops like Starbucks, DunkinΓÇÖ thanks to the pumpkin-spice latte 'halo effect'" (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/customers-are-rushing-to-coffee-shops-like-starbucks-dunkin-thanks-to-the-pumpkin-spice-latte-halo-effect-1867e34b?mod=mw_rss_topstories)
