Here is the news brief:  **Headline** Trump Seeks Fed "Majority" to Lower Rates  **Summary Meta Description** President Trump vows to have a majority of Federal Reserve members on his side soon, aiming to push interest rates lower after firing Chair Powell's predecessor. This move comes amidst growing economic concerns and a looming recession.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó President Trump has announced plans to build a majority of Fed members who will support lowering interest rates. ΓÇó This move is seen as an attempt to bypass the current rate-setting process, which Trump believes is holding back the economy. ΓÇó The sudden change in Federal Reserve leadership comes amidst growing economic concerns and a looming recession.  **Short Takeaways**  1. **Trump's Aggressive Approach**: By pushing for a Fed majority, Trump demonstrates his willingness to aggressively shape monetary policy, potentially putting him at odds with independent Fed officials. 2. **Implications for Economic Policy**: A shift in Fed leadership could have significant implications for the economy, particularly if interest rates are lowered further. This move may be seen as an attempt to boost economic growth, but it also increases the risk of inflation and asset bubbles.  **Sources** Source: CNBC - [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/26/trump-fed-majority-cook-interest-rates.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/26/trump-fed-majority-cook-interest-rates.html)
