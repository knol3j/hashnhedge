Here's the rewritten news brief:  **Headline:** Asia-Pacific Markets Mixed After Overnight Gains on Wall Street  **Summary Meta Description:** Asian stocks are trading mixed on Wednesday, following a positive session on Wall Street overnight. While India's Nifty 50 index and South Korea's Kospi index saw gains, other major markets in the region such as Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell.  **Key Points:**  * Indian stocks rise despite imposition of tariffs by US * China's Shanghai Composite Index falls 0.8% on Wednesday * Japan's Nikkei 225 index drops 1.2% amidst concerns over yen's strength * South Korea's Kospi index gains 1.3% as investors react to easing trade tensions  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The mixed performance in Asian markets reflects the region's ongoing uncertainty about the global economic outlook, with investors cautious after a volatile session on Wall Street. 2. Despite some positive developments, including India's tariff announcement and South Korea's improving trade relations with the US, market sentiment remains fragile due to lingering concerns over the impact of rising protectionism.  **Sources:** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/asia-pacific-markets-live-india-tariffs-nifty-50-nikkei-225.html
