**Headline:** ESA's Juice Spacecraft Returns to Life After Code Bug Fix  **Summary Meta Description:** European Space Agency engineers have resolved a communication anomaly with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) spacecraft, attributing the issue to a software bug. The spacecraft is now on track for a gravity-assist flyby near Venus.  **Key Points:**  * Communications with the Juice spacecraft were restored after ESA engineers fixed a code bug. * The spacecraft was experiencing issues due to a timer fail, which affected its ability to transmit data. * The anomaly occurred as the spacecraft approaches Venus for a gravity-assist maneuver on August 31.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Software bugs can be costly**: In space exploration, even minor errors in code can have significant consequences, highlighting the importance of rigorous testing and quality assurance processes. 2. **Resilience is key to space missions**: The ESA's swift response to the Juice anomaly underscores the critical role of adaptability and problem-solving in ensuring mission success.  **Sources:**  * https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/juice_communications_bug/
