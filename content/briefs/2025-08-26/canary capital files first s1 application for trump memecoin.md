**Headline** Canary Capital Submits Application for Trump Memecoin ETF  **Summary Meta Description** Canary Capital has filed an application with the SEC to launch a Trump-themed exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking the first step towards creating a memecoin-based investment product. The move comes as the cryptocurrency market continues to see growth in meme-inspired assets.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó Canary Capital submitted its S-1 application on February 14, seeking to register an ETF that tracks the price of Trump-themed cryptocurrencies. ΓÇó The proposed fund will have Trump-branded coins and tokens as underlying assets, which may be perceived as a joke or satire. ΓÇó A review by the SEC is expected before the ETF can be listed for trading.  **Takeaways**  1. This application highlights the growing interest in meme-based cryptocurrency investments, which often blend humor with financial speculation. If approved, this fund could further fuel demand for such assets. 2. The move also raises questions about the regulatory environment for these types of products and whether they will be treated as legitimate investment vehicles or dismissed as novelty items.  **Sources**  https://cryptoslate.com/canary-capital-files-first-s-1-application-for-trump-memecoin-etf-under-1933-act/
