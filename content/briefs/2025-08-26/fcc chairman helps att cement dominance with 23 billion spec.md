Here is the requested news brief:  **Headline:** AT&T Secures $23 Billion Spectrum Deal with EchoStar Acquisition  **Summary Meta Description:** The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved a deal between AT&T and EchoStar, valuing the spectrum acquisition at $23 billion. This massive purchase further consolidates AT&T's position as a dominant player in the US telecom market.  **Key Points:**  * The FCC has given its approval for AT&T to acquire EchoStar's satellite-based spectrum * The $23 billion deal marks one of the largest spectrum acquisitions in US history * The move will likely cement AT&T's status as a leader in 5G services and further entrench the "big three" oligopoly  **Takeaways:**  1. This deal represents another significant step towards the consolidation of the telecom industry, raising concerns about reduced competition and potential barriers to entry for new players. 2. As the FCC continues to evaluate its policies on spectrum allocation, this acquisition serves as a reminder of the ongoing debate surrounding the balance between private companies' interests and public access to essential communication infrastructure.  **Sources:**  [https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/att-to-buy-echostar-spectrum-for-23b-further-entrenching-big-3-oligopoly/](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/att-to-buy-echostar-spectrum-for-23b-further-entrenching-big-3-oligopoly/)
