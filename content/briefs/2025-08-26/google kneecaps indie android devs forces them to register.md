**Headline:** Google Tightens Android App Verification for Indie Developers  **Summary Meta Description:** Google is introducing developer verification for all Android apps, not just those installed from the Play Store, starting with four countries in September 2026 and expanding globally in 2027. This new policy affects indie developers who rely on sideloading, requiring them to register, pay fees, and submit paperwork.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Google will require developer verification for all Android apps, including sideloaded ones. ΓÇó The policy starts with Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand in September 2026. ΓÇó A global rollout is planned for 2027 and beyond. ΓÇó Indie developers will need to register, pay fees, and submit paperwork.  **Short Takeaways:**  * Google's move aims to increase app security and user trust, but it may also hinder indie developers' ability to distribute their apps easily. This could lead to a more centralized app ecosystem with less room for innovative or niche developers. * The policy's global rollout will be closely watched by the development community, as it may set a precedent for other countries to follow suit.  **Sources:** [www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/android_developer_verification_sideloading](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/android_developer_verification_sideloading)
