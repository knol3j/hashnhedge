Here is the news brief:  **Headline** Universal Antiviral Shows Promise in Animal Studies  **Summary Meta Description** Researchers at Columbia University have made a breakthrough in developing a single, universal antiviral therapy that can target multiple types of viruses. Early animal studies show promising results, but human trials are still needed to confirm efficacy.  **Key Points**  * The new therapy, called an "antibody-like" molecule, targets specific viral proteins rather than the virus itself. * It has shown effectiveness against a range of viruses, including HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 in animal studies. * The researchers believe their approach could potentially lead to a single treatment that can combat multiple types of viruses.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis**  1. While promising, this development is still in its early stages, and extensive human trials are needed before it can be considered for widespread use. 2. This universal antiviral therapy could have significant implications for public health, potentially reducing the need for targeted treatments and vaccines for each specific virus.  **Sources** * Columbia University Medical Center: https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all
