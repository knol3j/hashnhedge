**Headline** Future of Open Source in Jeopardy as Leadership Gap Widens  **Summary Meta Description** The open source community is grappling with a leadership crisis, as the current generation of maintainers prepares to retire or step down. A growing gap between experienced leaders and new contributors threatens the sustainability of projects.  **Key Points**  * The average age of open source project maintainers is increasing, raising concerns about the future of these projects. * Many long-time maintainers are nearing retirement or stepping down, leaving a leadership vacuum in their wake. * New contributors often lack the skills and experience to take over leadership roles, exacerbating the problem.  **Takeaways**  1. The open source community must adapt to the changing landscape by investing in training and mentorship programs for new contributors. 2. A more structured approach to knowledge transfer and succession planning is necessary to ensure the continuity of projects.  By neglecting to address the leadership gap, the open source community risks losing valuable experience and expertise, potentially crippling the sustainability of its projects.
