Here's a news brief based on the source:  **Headline:** Trump Targets Another Fed Official, Raising Fears of Institutional Damage  **Summary Meta Description:** President Trump's threat to fire another Federal Reserve official has Wall Street on high alert as investors weigh the risks of "scapegoat economics" against potential short-term gains. The move comes amid growing tensions between the White House and the central bank.  **Key Points:**  * Trump has threatened to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and now targets Lisa Cook, a newly appointed member * Wall Street is concerned about the impact on market stability and institutional credibility * Some economists argue that firing officials based on politics rather than merit undermines the Fed's independence  **Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. **Institutional Damage:** Trump's actions risk destabilizing the Federal Reserve, potentially leading to a loss of public trust in institutions. This could have long-term consequences for economic stability. 2. **Scapegoat Economics:** By targeting individual officials rather than addressing broader policy issues, Trump is employing a "scapegoat economics" approach that may provide short-term political benefits but undermine the Fed's ability to function effectively.  **Sources:** Fortune: [https://fortune.com/2025/08/26/trump-lisa-cook-fed-white-house/](https://fortune.com/2025/08/26/trump-lisa-cook-fed-white-house/)
