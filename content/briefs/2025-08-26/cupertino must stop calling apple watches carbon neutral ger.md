**Headline:**  Apple Ordered to Halt "Carbon Neutral" Watch Claims in Germany  **Summary Meta Description:** A German court has ruled that Apple must stop advertising its Watches as carbon-neutral, deeming the label misleading and violating the country's competition law. The decision comes after a complaint was filed against Apple for making unsubstantiated environmental claims.  **Key Points:**  * A German court has ordered Apple to cease labeling its Watches as "carbon neutral". * The ruling states that the claim is misleading and violates Germany's competition law. * The decision comes after a complaint was filed against Apple for allegedly making unsubstantiated environmental claims. * The court has not specified any alternative labels or language that Apple can use.  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis:**  1. **Environmental Marketing Scrutiny:** This ruling highlights the growing scrutiny of companies' environmental marketing claims, particularly in the tech industry. As consumers become increasingly environmentally conscious, regulators are taking a closer look at how companies like Apple make these claims. 2. **Global Implications:** This decision may set a precedent for other countries to follow suit, potentially leading to changes in how companies globally market their products as "carbon neutral" or eco-friendly.  **Sources:** https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/carbon_neutral_apple_watch/
