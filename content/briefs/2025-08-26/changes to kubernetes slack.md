**Headline** Kubernetes Community Faces Changes to Slack Workspace  **Summary Meta Description** The Kubernetes community will experience changes to its Slack workspace, with feature limitations taking effect on June 20, 2025. The community is exploring alternative platforms, including Discord, to replace the current Slack setup.  **Key Points**  * Kubernetes' free customized enterprise Slack account will be downgraded to a standard free Slack. * Feature limitations include retaining only 90 days of history and disabling certain apps and workflows. * The community is considering migrating to Discord as an alternative platform. * Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and User Group members should take actions to prepare for the upgrade.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis**  1. **Temporary Setback**: Although Kubernetes' Slack workspace will lose its special status, the community has been assured that it won't be downgraded on June 20th as initially feared. 2. **New Opportunities Ahead**: The shift away from Slack may lead to more flexibility and integration capabilities for the community, potentially through a Discord platform.  **Sources** * [https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/16/changes-to-kubernetes-slack/](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/16/changes-to-kubernetes-slack/)
