Here is the news brief based on the source:  **Headline**: EU Over-Regulation Hits Business Growth and Innovation  **Summary Meta Description**: The European Union's over-reliance on regulations is stifling business growth and innovation, according to a recent study. With the EU's regulatory framework growing increasingly complex, businesses are struggling to keep up, leading to reduced competitiveness and investment.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The EU's regulatory framework has become overly complex, with many industries facing multiple layers of regulations. ΓÇó Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are disproportionately affected by over-regulation, as they often lack the resources to comply. ΓÇó Over-regulation is driving businesses to relocate outside the EU or abandon innovative projects.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The EU's regulatory framework needs a comprehensive overhaul to ensure it does not stifle innovation and business growth. A more streamlined approach could help small businesses thrive, but may require changes to existing legislation. 2. While over-regulation is a pressing issue in the EU, the solution lies in striking a balance between protecting citizens' rights and supporting economic development.  **Sources:**  * https://about.fb.com/news/2025/08/how-eu-over-regulation-is-stifling-business-growth-and-innovation/
