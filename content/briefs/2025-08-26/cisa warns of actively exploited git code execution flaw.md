**Headline:**  CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Git Code Execution Vulnerability  **Summary Meta Description:** The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning about an actively exploited vulnerability in the Git version control system. The flaw, which allows code execution, has been identified as potentially severe and is being targeted by attackers.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. ΓÇó The flaw affects various versions of Git, including some older ones no longer supported. ΓÇó Attackers are exploiting the bug to execute arbitrary code on compromised systems.  **Takeaways:**  1.  This warning underscores the importance of regularly updating software and tools, especially those with widespread use like Git. It's a reminder that even seemingly secure systems can have vulnerabilities waiting to be exploited by attackers. 2.  The fact that CISA has identified this flaw as actively exploited suggests it's crucial for users to stay vigilant and take proactive steps in securing their systems against potential threats.  **Sources:**  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-of-actively-exploited-git-code-execution-flaw/
