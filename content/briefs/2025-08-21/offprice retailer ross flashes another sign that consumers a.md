**Headline**: Ross Sees Surge in Discounted Sales as Consumers Opt for Deals  **Summary Meta Description**: Ross Stores reports increased sales of discounted merchandise, following a similar trend at TJ Maxx's parent company. This shift suggests consumers are prioritizing value over full-price purchases.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Ross Stores' comparable-store sales rose 5% in the third quarter, driven by a 6% increase in same-store sales. ΓÇó The retailer attributed the growth to strong sales of discounted merchandise, with customers seeking out deals on designer and brand-name items. ΓÇó This trend mirrors TJX Companies, the parent of TJ Maxx, which reported a similar surge in off-price sales.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. Consumers' growing preference for discounted merchandise may indicate a longer-term shift away from full-price shopping, as retailers with strong value propositions gain traction. 2. With more consumers seeking deals, retailers like Ross and TJ Maxx are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, but it remains to be seen whether the surge will continue into the holiday season.  **Sources**: MarketWatch - "Ross Stores flash another sign that consumers are seeking discounts this fall" (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ross-stores-flash-another-sign-that-consumers-are-seeking-discounts-this-fall-3697b70f?mod=mw_rss_topstories)
