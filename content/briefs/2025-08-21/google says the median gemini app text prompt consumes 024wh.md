**Headline:** Google Reveals Energy Footprint of Gemini App Prompts  **Summary Meta Description:** Google estimates that the median text prompt for its Gemini app consumes about as much energy as running a microwave for one second and generates equivalent CO2 emissions. This revelation raises questions about the environmental sustainability of large language models.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The estimated energy consumption is 0.24Wh per prompt, comparable to a microwave's power draw for one second. ΓÇó The equivalent CO2 emissions are reported as 0.03g, a relatively small but not insignificant amount considering the scale of Gemini usage. ΓÇó This data comes from Google itself, providing a rare insight into the environmental impact of its language model technology.  **Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. **Energy Efficiency vs. Impact:** While 0.24Wh might seem like a negligible amount, it's essential to consider the sheer number of prompts generated by Gemini and other large language models. The cumulative effect could be substantial. 2. **A Glimpse into the Future of Sustainability:** This disclosure from Google highlights the pressing need for sustainable AI practices. As language models continue to grow in popularity, understanding their environmental implications will become increasingly crucial.  **Sources:**  Source: MIT Technology Review (via TechMeme) Link: http://www.techmeme.com/250821/p23#a250821p23
