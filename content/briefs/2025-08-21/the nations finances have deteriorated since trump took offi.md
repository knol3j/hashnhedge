Here is a news brief based on the source:  **Headline**: US Deficit Swells to $28.5 Trillion, Warns CRFB  **Summary Meta Description**: The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) warns that the nation's finances have significantly deteriorated since Trump took office, with projected deficits reaching as high as $28.5 trillion by 2025. Tariffs imposed during his presidency are partly to blame.  **Key Points**  * The CRFB projects a national debt of over $33 trillion by 2025 * Tariffs imposed under Trump's presidency have added an estimated $100 billion to the deficit * The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects budget deficits to average 4.9% of GDP from 2020-2025, exceeding pre-pandemic levels  **Takeaways**  1. **Trump-era policies exacerbate deficit**: Tariffs and other policy decisions made during Trump's presidency have contributed significantly to the growing national debt. 2. **Fiscal sustainability at risk**: With projected deficits reaching unprecedented levels, policymakers will face significant challenges in ensuring fiscal sustainability.  **Sources**: The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) report is available at fortune.com/2025/08/21/how-big-deficit-trump-tariffs-crfb/.
