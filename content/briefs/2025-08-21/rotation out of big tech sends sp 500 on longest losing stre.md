**Headline:** S&P 500 Plummets on Big Tech Rotation  **Summary Meta Description:** The S&P 500 is experiencing its longest losing streak since January due to a rotation out of big tech companies, which are dragging down the broader index. Despite other sectors holding up this week, the impact of this trend remains uncertain.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The S&P 500 has suffered its longest losing streak since January, largely driven by declines in big tech companies. ΓÇó Other sectors within the index have been relatively stable this week, but are being pulled down by these tech giants. ΓÇó Analysts are questioning how far the losses will extend and when a turnaround might occur.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The current trend highlights the significant influence of Big Tech on the broader market, with even stable sectors getting pulled down by their decline. 2.
