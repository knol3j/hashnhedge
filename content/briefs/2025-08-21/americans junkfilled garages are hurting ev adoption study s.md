**Headline:** Garage Clutter Hindering Electric Vehicle Adoption, Study Finds  **Summary Meta Description:** A recent study reveals that Americans' cluttered garages are a significant obstacle to electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The research suggests that many potential EV buyers lack the space required for charging infrastructure, highlighting an often-overlooked challenge in the transition to electric vehicles.  **Key Points:**  * A new study has identified garage clutter as a major hindrance to EV adoption in the US. * Many Americans lack the necessary space to accommodate EV charging infrastructure. * This issue is not limited to urban areas, with suburban and rural residents also facing challenges. * The study's findings highlight the need for more practical and accessible solutions for EV owners.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Charging Infrastructure as a Barrier**: The study underscores the importance of considering charging infrastructure needs when evaluating the feasibility of EV adoption. This is not just a matter of having an outlet, but also ensuring there is sufficient space to accommodate the charger itself. 2. **Need for Inclusive Solutions**: As the world shifts towards electric vehicles, manufacturers and policymakers must prioritize inclusive solutions that cater to diverse household situations. This might involve developing more compact or versatile charging options.  **Sources:**  https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/junk-filled-garages-hurt-ev-sales-as-people-don't-have-room-for-chargers/
