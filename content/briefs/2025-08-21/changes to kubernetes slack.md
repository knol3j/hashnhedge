**Headline** Kubernetes Community to Migrate from Slack due to Downgrade  **Summary Meta Description** The Kubernetes community will lose its special Slack status and face feature limitations as of June 20, 2025. A new platform may be implemented later this year.  **Key Points**  * Kubernetes Slack will be downgraded to a standard free account on June 20, 2025 * Feature limitations will include limited message history (90 days) and app/workflow restrictions * Channel owners and private channel members must take actions to preserve information before the upgrade  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis** The Kubernetes community's Slack downgrade reflects the platform's increasing costs and limitations. This change may prompt a migration to a new communication platform, such as Discord.
