**Headline**: Microsoft Restricts China's Access to Early Bug Disclosures  **Summary Meta Description**: Microsoft has reportedly stopped providing Chinese companies with proof-of-concept exploit code for soon-to-be-disclosed vulnerabilities, following last month's SharePoint zero-day attacks. This move is part of a broader shift in the company's bug-notification program.  **Key Points**  * Microsoft has ended early access to bug disclosures and PoC exploit code for Chinese companies * The decision follows last month's SharePoint zero-day attacks, which exploited a vulnerability in Redmond's early-bug-notification program * The change affects China-based companies' ability to receive sensitive security information before public disclosure  **Short Takeaways**  1. Microsoft's decision reflects growing concerns about the potential misuse of sensitive security information by Chinese companies. 2. This move may signal a broader shift in Microsoft's approach to bug-disclosure programs, potentially impacting other regions and industries.  **Sources**: The Register: [https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/microsoft_cuts_chinas_early_access/](https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/microsoft_cuts_chinas_early_access/)
