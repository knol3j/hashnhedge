**Headline** SEC Commissioner Criticizes Plan for Barclays Settlement Fund Distribution  **Summary Meta Description** SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce dissents from the order approving a plan to distribute a settlement fund related to Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC. She criticizes the plan for prioritizing certain claimants over others, arguing that it undermines the principle of equal treatment under the law.  **Key Points**  * SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce dissented from an order approving a plan to distribute a settlement fund related to Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC. * The plan would give priority to certain claimants, including those with complex claims, potentially leaving others without compensation. * Peirce argues that this approach undermines the principle of equal treatment under the law.  **Short Takeaways**  1. **Unequal Treatment**: Commissioner Peirce's dissent highlights concerns about unequal treatment of claimants in the settlement fund distribution plan. This raises questions about fairness and accountability in the process. 2. **Accountability Gap**: The decision to prioritize certain claimants over others may create an accountability gap, where some parties are held to different standards than others. This could undermine trust in the system.  **Sources**  * https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-barclays-fairfund-080125
