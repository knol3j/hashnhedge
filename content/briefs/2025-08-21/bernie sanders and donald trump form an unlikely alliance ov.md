Donald Trump have formed an unlikely alliance to push for billions in subsidies for Intel, a move that highlights the complexities of bipartisanship in Washington.  **Key Points:**  * Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and former President Donald Trump have joined forces on a bill providing up to $20 billion in subsidies for Intel's semiconductor production. * The unusual alliance aims to boost US chip manufacturing capacity, which has become increasingly reliant on foreign suppliers amid global supply chain disruptions. * Critics argue the proposal could benefit Intel significantly while leaving smaller manufacturers behind.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Unlikely partners:** The unlikely alliance between Sanders and Trump underscores the complexity of bipartisanship in Washington, where lawmakers often put aside ideological differences to advance key policy initiatives. 2. **National security implications:** The proposed subsidies for Intel's semiconductor production raise questions about the long-term impact on national security, as the US becomes increasingly dependent on foreign suppliers.  **Sources:** https://fortune.com/2025/08/21/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-intel-chips/
