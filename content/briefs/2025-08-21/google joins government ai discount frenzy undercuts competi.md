**Headline** Google Cuts AI Deal with Government Agencies at $0.47 per Unit  **Summary Meta Description** Google joins the fray of discounted generative AI deals with government agencies, undercutting competition with a price of $0.47 per unit. This move follows similar agreements between Anthropic and OpenAI, raising concerns about the long-term implications for taxpayers and innovation.  **Key Points**  * Google has signed a deal to supply its AI models to government agencies at a discounted rate of $0.47 per unit. * This agreement brings the major generative AI model makers into line with one another in offering similar discounts. * The terms of these deals have been criticized for prioritizing short-term savings over long-term innovation and potential risks.  **Takeaways**  * Google's decision to match its competitors' prices may be a strategic move to maintain market share, but it also raises questions about the sustainability of such discounts. * The focus on short-term cost savings could ultimately hinder innovation in AI development, as companies prioritize profits over investing in research and development.  **Sources** https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/google_govt_discount_ai/
