**Headline** SEC Approves In-Kind Creation and Redemption for Crypto ETFs  **Summary Meta Description** The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved in-kind creations and redemptions for cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs), allowing for more efficient trading and potentially increased investor access to these assets.  **Key Points**  * The SEC's approval allows crypto ETPs to create new shares by delivering underlying assets, such as cryptocurrencies, rather than using cash. * This in-kind creation process is expected to reduce costs and increase trading efficiency for investors. * The approval applies to all registered crypto ETPs that meet the necessary requirements.  **Short Takeaways**  1. The SEC's move is seen as a step towards increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency-based investments, as it addresses one of the main barriers to entry: high fees associated with traditional cash-redemption methods. 2. However, some experts caution that this development may also attract more speculative investors, potentially leading to increased market volatility.  **Sources** * [https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-crypto-exchange-traded-products-072925](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-crypto-exchange-traded-products-072925)
