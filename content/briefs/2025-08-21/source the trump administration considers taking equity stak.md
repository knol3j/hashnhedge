**Headline**: Trump Admin Eyes Equity Stakes in CHIPS Act Recipients  **Summary Meta Description**: The Trump administration is considering taking equity stakes in companies that receive funding from the CHIPS Act, but not in firms already investing heavily in US production. This move could impact the semiconductor industry's future.  **Key Points**  * The Trump administration is exploring taking equity stakes in companies receiving CHIPS Act funds * Recipients may be required to issue new shares or warrants to the government * Companies already increasing investment in US production, like TSMC and Micron, are exempt from this consideration  **Takeaways and Analysis**  1. The potential equity stake requirement could alter the dynamics of the semiconductor industry's funding landscape, potentially attracting more investment from private companies. 2. This move may be seen as a way to ensure that government-funded projects contribute directly to US economic growth and job creation.  **Sources**:  http://www.techmeme.com/250821/p31#a250821p31
