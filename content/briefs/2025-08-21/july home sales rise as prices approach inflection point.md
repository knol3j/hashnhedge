**Headline** Home Sales Rise Amid Cooling Prices  **Summary Meta Description** The US housing market saw a surge in home sales for July, but price growth is slowing down. Experts warn that prices may soon reach an inflection point, potentially leading to a shift in the market. The report highlights the ongoing trend of rising sales and cooling price increases.  **Key Points**  * Home sales rose by 3.6% year-over-year in July * Median home prices increased 5.4% from last year * Price growth is slowing down, with some regions showing a decline * Inventory levels remain low, but are increasing gradually  **Takeaways and Analysis**  1. The recent increase in home sales suggests that buyers may be regaining confidence in the market. 2. However, prices are not keeping pace with sales growth, indicating a potential inflection point where demand slows down.  The rise in home sales is a mixed signal for the housing market. While it indicates some stability, the slowing price growth and increasing inventory levels suggest that prices may soon plateau or decline. This could be an opportunity for buyers to enter the market, but sellers should be prepared for potential shifts in the market dynamics.
