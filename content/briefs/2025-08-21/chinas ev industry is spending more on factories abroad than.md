Here are the requested elements:  **Headline** China's EV Industry Turns to Abroad for Expansion  **Summary Meta Description** For the first time, China's electric vehicle industry is investing more in factories abroad than at home, signaling a shift in its growth strategy. Chinese companies are setting up production lines in countries with favorable incentives and lower costs, while also expanding their global reach.  **Key Points**  * China's EV industry has surpassed South Korea as the world's second-largest market. * For the first time, foreign investment in EV manufacturing in China has exceeded domestic investment. * Companies like BYD and Geely are leading the trend of investing abroad. * Countries with favorable policies, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, have attracted Chinese investors.  **Short Takeaways**  1. China's EV industry is no longer solely focused on domestic growth, reflecting a shift towards global expansion. As companies seek to reduce costs and tap into new markets, foreign investment in EV manufacturing is becoming an increasingly important strategy. 2. The trend of investing abroad may also have implications for China's economic and trade policies, as the country's industries become more integrated with those of other nations.  **Sources** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/chinas-electric-car-industry-invests-more-overseas-than-at-home.html
