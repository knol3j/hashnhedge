**Headline:** Trump Unveils "Peculiar" Policy Playbook Favoring Russia, China Over India  **Summary Meta Description:** U.S. President Donald Trump has revealed a policy approach that prioritizes trade relief for China and red carpet treatment for Russian leader Vladimir Putin over penalties for India. This unusual strategy raises questions about the implications of such decisions on global relations.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The Trump administration is reportedly considering trade concessions for China to address intellectual property theft and market access issues. ΓÇó In contrast, India faces increasing scrutiny from Washington, with potential sanctions over nuclear non-proliferation concerns. ΓÇó Russia's President Putin has received a welcoming stance from the U.S., despite ongoing tensions between the two nations.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The Trump administration's policy priorities appear to be driven by short-term economic interests rather than long-term strategic considerations, which may have far-reaching consequences for global relationships. 2. This "peculiar" policy approach is likely to spark debate among policymakers and experts, who will scrutinize the motivations behind such decisions.  **Sources:**  * CNBC: "Red carpet for Putin, trade relief for China, penalties on India: Inside Trump's peculiar policy playbook" 	+ https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/trump-us-policy-china-india-russia.html
