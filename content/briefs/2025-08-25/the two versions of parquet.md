**Headline:** "Parquet's Dual Nature Revealed"  **Summary Meta Description:** "The popular data processing framework has two distinct versions, leading to confusion among developers. Understand the differences and implications for big data applications."  **Key Points:**  * The Parquet library has two separate repositories, one maintained by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and another by the original author, Patrick Dullaart. * The ASF repository is a fork of the original codebase and includes additional features not present in the Dullaart repository. * Developers using Parquet must choose between the two versions, which can lead to inconsistencies and difficulties in maintaining compatibility.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Forked Development**: The dual nature of Parquet highlights the challenges that arise when open-source projects are maintained by multiple parties. 2. **Implications for Big Data**: Developers working on big data applications must carefully consider which version of Parquet to use, as it can impact performance and compatibility.  **Sources:** [www.jeronimo.dev/the-two-versions-of-parquet/](https://www.jeronimo.dev/the-two-versions-of-parquet/)
