Here's the news brief:  **Headline:** Trees Tap Leaks in Drought  **Summary Meta Description:** A study reveals that trees on city streets are adapting to drought by drinking from leaky water pipes, highlighting the need for municipalities to prioritize infrastructure repair.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Research found that trees near leaky pipes had better water availability and tree growth compared to those farther away. ΓÇó The study suggests that leaky pipes can provide an unintended source of water for urban trees during droughts. ΓÇó This phenomenon is particularly significant in cities with aging infrastructure, where leaks are more common.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. As climate change exacerbates droughts, municipalities must balance the need to repair leaky pipes with the potential benefits of allowing trees to tap into them. 2. The study highlights the importance of considering urban ecosystems and their interactions with municipal infrastructure when developing water management strategies.  **Sources:**  New Scientist: "Trees on city streets cope with drought by drinking from leaky pipes" (https://www.newscientist.com/article/2487804-trees-on-city-streets-cope-with-drought-by-drinking-from-leaky-pipes/)
