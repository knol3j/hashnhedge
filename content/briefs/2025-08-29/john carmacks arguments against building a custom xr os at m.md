**Headline** Carmack Skeptical of Custom XR OS Effort by Meta  **Summary** John Carmack, former CTO of Oculus and ZeniMax, shares his thoughts on the feasibility of building a custom XR operating system at Meta. He raises concerns about the complexity and limitations of such an endeavor.  **Key Points**  * Carmack suggests that creating a custom XR OS might be more trouble than it's worth. * He points out that the industry has seen various failed attempts to create proprietary XR platforms. * The technical challenges, such as compatibility issues and limited developer support, are significant hurdles.  **Takeaways** 1.  **Customization vs. Complexity**: Carmack highlights the delicate balance between customization and complexity when it comes to operating systems. A custom OS may provide unique features but also introduces additional technical debt. 2.  **Industry Lessons Learned**: The XR industry has a history of failed proprietary platform attempts, which could be a cautionary tale for Meta's ambitions.  **Sources** * John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1961172409920491849
