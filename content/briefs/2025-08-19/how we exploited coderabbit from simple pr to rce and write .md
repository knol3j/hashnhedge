Here's the news brief:  **Headline**: CodeRabbit Vulnerability Exploited for RCE, Write Access on 1M Repos  **Summary Meta Description**: Researchers detail how a single vulnerability in CodeRabbit was exploited to gain remote code execution (RCE) and write access on over one million repositories. The attack chain involved multiple steps, from a simple PR to full administrative control.  **Key Points**  * A single vulnerability in CodeRabbit was exploited to gain RCE and write access on over 1 million repositories. * Attackers created a malicious pull request that went unnoticed by the repository owners. * The attackers then escalated privileges using the vulnerability, gaining full administrative control of the repository. * Researchers were able to track the attack chain and reproduce the exploit.  **Takeaways**  * The CodeRabbit vulnerability highlights the importance of regular security audits and updates for third-party libraries. While the exploit was sophisticated, it was ultimately based on a single vulnerability that could have been addressed with proper maintenance. * The ease with which attackers were able to escalate privileges in this case suggests that code repositories may be more vulnerable to attack than previously thought.  **Sources**  * Kudelski Security Research: "How we exploited CodeRabbit from a simple PR to RCE and write access on 1M repositories" (https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2025/08/19/how-we-exploited-coderabbit-from-a-simple-pr-to-rce-and-write-access-on-1m-repositories/)
