**Elastic Denies Zero-Day Vulnerability in Defend EDR**  A cybersecurity company has disputed claims of a zero-day Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw in its Elastic Security product, sparking debate over the vulnerability's existence and severity.  ΓÇó Elastic rejects claims of a critical security vulnerability in its Defend Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software. ΓÇó The alleged flaw would have allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially leading to data breaches or malware infections. ΓÇó A zero-day exploit is typically unpatched by the vendor at the time of discovery, making it an especially concerning issue.  **Two Key Takeaways:**  1.  Elastic's denial raises questions about the validity of the initial claims and whether a genuine vulnerability was discovered or if it was simply misreported. 2.  The controversy highlights ongoing concerns over security vulnerabilities in software products and the need for rigorous testing and patching processes to prevent potential exploits.  **Sources:** BleepingComputer, [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/elastic-rejects-claims-of-a-zero-day-rce-flaw-in-defend-edr/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/elastic-rejects-claims-of-a-zero-day-rce-flaw-in-defend-edr/)
