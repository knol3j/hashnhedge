Here's the requested news brief:  **Headline:** US Natural Gas Futures Decline on Weather Forecast Adjustments  **Summary Meta Description:** The price of U.S. natural gas futures falls as forecasters adjust their predictions for winter weather, potentially reducing demand for heating fuels.  **Key Points:**  * Natural gas futures declined 3.2% to $2.93 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) after a shift in weather forecasts. * Warmer-than-expected temperatures are expected in the Midwest and Northeast, leading to reduced heating demand. * The Energy Information Administration reported a 5% decrease in natural gas production for this week.  **Takeaways:**  1. **Weather forecasting plays a significant role** in determining natural gas prices, as changes in temperature forecasts can impact demand for heating fuels. 2. **Increased natural gas production** is not enough to offset reduced demand caused by warmer temperatures, leading to decreased futures prices.  **Sources:**  https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-natural-gas-futures-fall-on-shifting-weather-forecasts-1ef3e457?mod=rss_markets_main
