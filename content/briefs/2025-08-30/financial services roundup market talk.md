**Headline:** Banks to Face Higher Capital Requirements Under EU Proposal  **Summary Meta Description:** The European Union's financial regulatory body proposes stricter capital requirements for banks, potentially affecting their lending capacity and profitability. The new rules aim to enhance stability in the financial system but may pose challenges for banks.  **Key Points:**  * The European Banking Authority (EBA) recommends increasing minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratios for banks. * The proposed rule change would apply to approximately 5,000 European banks, with some exceptions for smaller institutions. * Banks might need to hold more capital in reserve, potentially reducing their ability to lend.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Increased regulatory burden**: The EU's proposal could impose significant costs on banks, which may lead to reduced lending capacity and increased borrowing costs for consumers. 2. **Systemic stability vs. bank profitability**: While the new rules aim to enhance financial system resilience, they may also compromise bank profitability, potentially affecting their ability to invest in growth initiatives.  **Sources:** [https://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-services-roundup-market-talk-94f52cba?mod=rss_markets_main](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-services-roundup-market-talk-94f52cba?mod=rss_markets_main)
