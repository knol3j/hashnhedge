**Headline:** Arabica Coffee Prices Reach Record High Amid U.S.-Colombia Trade Tensions  **Summary Meta Description:** Global arabica coffee prices surge to a new record as the US and Colombia engage in a tariff dispute, exacerbating supply chain disruptions and adding pressure on an already strained market. The escalating trade tensions have further driven up prices, which are expected to remain volatile.  **Key Points:**  * Arabica coffee prices hit a record high due to a combination of factors, including supply chain disruptions and the ongoing US-Colombia tariff spat. * The US has imposed tariffs on Colombian coffee imports, while Colombia has retaliated with its own tariffs on US agricultural products. * The trade tensions have led to increased uncertainty in global coffee markets, driving up prices and impacting producers and consumers alike. * Other factors contributing to the price surge include droughts in Brazil, frost damage in Ethiopia, and ongoing supply chain disruptions.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Trade Tensions Escalate**: The US-Colombia tariff dispute is the latest development in a series of trade tensions affecting global coffee markets. As trade relations between major producing countries continue to deteriorate, market volatility is expected to remain high. 2. **Price Volatility Ahead**: With no clear resolution to the trade dispute in sight, prices are likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Producers and consumers will need to navigate this uncertainty to mitigate risks and ensure a stable supply chain.  **Sources:** https://www.wsj.com/articles/arabica-coffee-prices-hit-new-high-on-u-s-colombia-tariff-spat-582446fe?mod=rss_markets_main
