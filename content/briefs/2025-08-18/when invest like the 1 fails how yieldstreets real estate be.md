**Headline:** Yieldstreet's High-Risk Real Estate Bets Leave Customers Reeling  **Summary Meta Description:** A CNBC investigation reveals that Yieldstreet, a platform touting investment strategies for the wealthy, has led some customers to suffer significant losses through its high-risk real estate investments. The company's promise of "invest like the 1%" may have come at a steep price.  **Key Points:**  * Yieldstreet's real estate bets have resulted in substantial losses for some clients * The platform's investment strategies were designed to mimic those of high-net-worth individuals * Investors were attracted by potential returns, but many have seen their portfolios decline significantly * The company has faced criticism over its aggressive marketing tactics and lack of transparency  **Takeaways:**  1. **Overpromising and Underperforming**: Yieldstreet's promise of "invest like the 1%" may have created unrealistic expectations among customers, leading some to invest in high-risk assets without a clear understanding of the potential consequences. 2. **The Dangers of Mimicry**: While mimicking investment strategies from the wealthy can be appealing, it often involves taking on significant risk. This case highlights the importance of transparency and clear communication in investment products.  **Sources:** [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/yieldstreet-real-estate-bets-customer-losses.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/yieldstreet-real-estate-bets-customer-losses.html)
