**Headline:** Facebook to Ban Political Ads in EU Ahead of New Regulations  **Summary Meta Description:** Facebook announces plans to ban all political, electoral, and social issue ads in the European Union starting early next year. The move comes as a response to incoming regulations that aim to increase transparency and accountability in online advertising.  **Key Points:**  * Facebook will ban all political, electoral, and social issue ads in the EU on January 1st * This decision is in anticipation of new regulations set to take effect in early 2026 * The move aims to increase transparency and accountability in online advertising * Political advertisers will no longer be able to target specific demographics or interests  **Short Takeaways:**  Facebook's decision to ban political ads in the EU marks a significant shift towards increased transparency in online advertising. While this move is intended to comply with new regulations, it also raises questions about the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse.  The incoming European regulation is expected to have far-reaching implications for the way politicians and advocacy groups use social media to reach their audiences. As more countries consider similar legislation, Facebook's decision may set a precedent for other tech giants to follow.  **Sources:** https://about.fb.com/news/2025/07/ending-political-electoral-and-social-issue-advertising-in-the-eu/
