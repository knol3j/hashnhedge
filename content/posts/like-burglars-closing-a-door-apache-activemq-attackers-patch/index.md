ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Attackers fixed the flaw after establishing persistence on Linux servers. ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Vulnerability was used to gain access to servers with minimal detection. ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Apache ActiveMQ has been made aware of the issue and is working on patches.  **Short Takeaways**  1. The fact that attackers are patching the vulnerability suggests they may be motivated by a desire to remain undetected, rather than financial gain. 2.
