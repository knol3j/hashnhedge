**Headline:** Email Security Needs an "EDR Moment"  **Summary Meta Description:** Cybersecurity experts argue that email security needs to move beyond prevention and focus on detection and response, similar to the evolution of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. This shift is crucial as attackers become increasingly sophisticated.  **Bullet Key Points:**  GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³ Email security has largely focused on preventing attacks through filters and signatures. GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³ However, this approach is no longer effective against advanced threats. GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³ Experts recommend a move towards detection and response capabilities in email security. GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³ This would allow for real-time monitoring and swift action against detected threats. GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³ Similar to EDR solutions, which focus on endpoint protection.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The current state of email security is insufficient against evolving threats, highlighting the need for a more proactive approach. 2. By adopting detection and response capabilities, organizations can better defend themselves against sophisticated attacks and stay ahead of cybercriminals.  **Sources:** BleepingComputer - "Why Email Security Needs Its EDR Moment to Move Beyond Prevention" (https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/why-email-security-needs-its-edr-moment-to-move-beyond-prevention/)
