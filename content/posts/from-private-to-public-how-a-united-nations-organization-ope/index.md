**Headline** UN Agency Releases Code, Fosters Collaboration and Innovation  **Summary Meta Description** The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has successfully transitioned its in-house software development to open-source, leveraging GitHub's platform. This move enables collaboration with external experts, accelerates innovation, and ensures transparency in global food security efforts.  **Key Points:**  * The FAO leveraged GitHub's platform to migrate their codebase to an open-source model. * Four key steps were taken: setting clear goals, selecting the right tools, onboarding internal teams, and engaging with external contributors. * By going public, the FAO has fostered collaboration, innovation, and transparency in its global food security efforts.  **Takeaways**  1. **Innovation through Collaboration**: The FAO's open-sourcing of their codebase demonstrates the potential for international organizations to harness collective expertise and accelerate innovation in global development projects. 2. **Transparency in Global Development**: By making their software development process transparent, the FAO sets a precedent for other organizations to prioritize openness and collaboration in tackling complex global challenges.  **Sources** https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/from-private-to-public-how-a-united-nations-organization-open-sourced-its-tech-in-four-steps/
