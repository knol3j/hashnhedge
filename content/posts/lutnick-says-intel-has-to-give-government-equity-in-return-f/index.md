**Headline** Intel Seeks Government Equity Swap for CHIPS Act Funds  **Summary Meta Description** Intel's pursuit of government funding through the CHIPS Act has hit a snag, as the company faces demands from lawmakers to provide equity in return. This development raises questions about the long-term implications of public investment in the tech industry.  **Key Points**  * Intel is seeking $20 billion in government funding under the CHIPS Act * Lawmakers are pushing for equity stakes in exchange for funds * The move has sparked debate over government involvement in private enterprise * Other tech companies, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), may also face similar demands  **Takeaways**  1. Intel's reliance on government funding to stay competitive has created an unexpected consequence: the potential for public control or influence over the company's operations. 2.
