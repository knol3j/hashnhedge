**Headline**: Yieldstreet Real Estate Bets Leave Customers With Massive Losses  **Meta Description**: Yieldstreet, a platform offering investments in real estate and other alternative assets, has been criticized for its investment strategies that led to significant losses for customers. The platform's real estate bets have been particularly problematic, leaving many investors with substantial financial setbacks.  **Key Points:**  * Yieldstreet's real estate investments were marketed as low-risk opportunities to diversify portfolios * However, these investments have resulted in substantial losses for some clients * Regulatory scrutiny is increasing as concerns mount over the platform's business practices  **Takeaways and Analysis**:  1. **The Risks of Mimicking Elite Investors**: Yieldstreet's promise to 'invest like the 1%" may be appealing, but it ignores the complexity and risks involved in high-stakes investing. The platform's real estate bets demonstrate that even experienced investors can make costly mistakes. 2. **Regulatory Oversight**: As regulatory scrutiny intensifies, Yieldstreet and similar platforms must ensure transparency and accountability in their investment strategies to avoid further losses for customers.  **Sources:** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/yieldstreet-real-estate-bets-customer-losses.html
