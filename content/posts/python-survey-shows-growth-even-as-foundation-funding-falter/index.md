**Headline** Python Developers Stick to Old Habits Despite Growth  **Summary Meta Description** The 2024 Python Developer Survey reveals growth in the programming language's adoption, but a majority of developers continue to use earlier releases, with 3.13 lagging behind.  **Key Points**  * The Python Software Foundation (PSF) and JetBrains published their eighth annual survey on Python developer habits. * The survey gathered data from over 30,000 contributors, making it the largest yet. * Despite growth in adoption, most developers (67%) stick to earlier releases of Python, while 3.13 lags behind. * Popular use cases for Python include web development, data science, and machine learning.  **Short Takeaways**  1. The survey suggests that while Python's overall popularity is growing, its ecosystem may be struggling to keep pace with developer needs, leading to a preference for earlier releases. 2. The slow adoption of newer Python versions highlights the importance of backward compatibility and ease of migration in language development.  **Sources** The 2024 Python Developer Survey results were published by the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and JetBrains, available at [https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-2024-python-developer-survey.html](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-2024-python-developer-survey.html).
