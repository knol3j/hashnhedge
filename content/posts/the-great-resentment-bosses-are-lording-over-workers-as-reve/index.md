Here's a rewritten news brief based on the source:  **Headline** Bosses Crack Down on Workers Amid "Great Resentment"  **Summary Meta Description** As employees demand better work-life balance, companies are pushing back with stricter policies and fewer remote work options. But is this backlash justified? Fortune reports on the growing tension between workers and employers.  **Key Points:**  GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³ Companies are implementing stricter return-to-office policies in response to employee demands for better work-life balance. GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³ Many bosses feel they were taken advantage of during the pandemic, when they had to offer generous raises and perks to retain employees. GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³ The trend is part of a broader "Great Resentment" between workers and employers, with both sides feeling wronged by each other.  **Short Takeaways:**  * Companies are struggling to adapt to shifting employee expectations and changing attitudes towards work.  * As the pandemic showed, employees' needs and preferences can no longer be ignored; companies must find new ways to balance productivity and worker satisfaction.  **Sources** Fortune: The Great Resentment: Bosses are lording over workers as revenge for the Great Resignation when they had to hand out once-in-a-generation raises (https://fortune.com/2025/08/20/great-resentment-revenge-return-to-office-remote-work/)
