**Headline** 'VMware on AWS Gets a Boost with New Elastic Service"  **Summary Meta Description** Amazon has introduced the Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS), allowing organizations to run VMware Cloud Foundation environments directly within AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). This move simplifies workload migration while maintaining familiarity with existing tools, and provides access to AWS' scalability, agility, and elasticity.  **Bullet Key Points**  * Amazon EVS enables running VMware Cloud Foundation on AWS VPCs * Simplifies workload migration for organizations using VMware * Maintains familiarity with existing tools and infrastructure * Provides access to AWS' scalability, agility, and elasticity  **Takeaways** Amazon's new service offers a seamless way for companies to integrate their existing VMware environments with the cloud. This integration can streamline operations and unlock greater flexibility in resource allocation. However, it remains to be seen whether this move will spark wider adoption of hybrid cloud strategies among enterprises.  **Sources** * https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-elastic-vmware-service-for-running-vmware-cloud-foundation-on-aws/
