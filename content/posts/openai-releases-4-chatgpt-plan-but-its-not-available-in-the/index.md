Here is a news brief based on the source:  **Headline:** OpenAI Unveils $4 ChatGPT Plan, Excludes US Users for Now  **Summary Meta Description:** OpenAI has introduced a new pricing plan for its popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, offering users access to premium features for just $4 per month. However, the company has announced that this plan will not be available in the United States at launch.  **Key Points:**  * The new $4 plan includes access to advanced features and customization options * OpenAI has stated that it plans to make the plan available in other regions, including the US, 'soon" * Existing users can upgrade to the new plan immediately, while new users can sign up for a free trial * The company has not provided a specific timeline for when the plan will be available in the US  **Takeaways:**  1. OpenAI's move to introduce a lower-cost plan is likely aimed at expanding its user base and increasing adoption of its AI technology. 2. The exclusion of the US market from this initial launch may indicate regulatory or other issues that the company needs to address before making the plan available in the region.  **Sources:** [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openai-releases-4-chatgpt-plan-but-its-not-available-in-the-us-for-now/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openai-releases-4-chatgpt-plan-but-its-not-available-in-the-us-for-now/)
