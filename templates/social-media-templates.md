### Template 1: Breaking News Hot Take
```
üö® BREAKING: [Event] just happened and everyone's missing the real story

While CT is losing their minds over [surface-level reaction], here's what actually matters:

üßµ Thread (1/8)

1/ [Immediate context with attitude]
Example: "The $XXXm [Protocol] exploit everyone's calling a 'hack' was actually a masterclass in economic game theory. Here's why the 'victim' might have seen this coming..."

2/ [Why the obvious take is wrong]
Example: "Everyone's screaming about 'smart contract bugs' but this wasn't a code issue - it was a fundamental design flaw that's been hiding in plain sight for months."

3/ [Technical breakdown for the smart money]
Example: "The exploit used [technical explanation] - which means every other protocol using similar mechanics is now a sitting duck."

4/ [Who benefits from this chaos]
Example: "While retail panics, notice how [specific players] conveniently moved funds 48 hours ago. Coincidence? In crypto, there are no coincidences."

5/ [Broader implications]
Example: "This isn't just about one protocol. It exposes a fundamental problem with [broader issue] that's about to affect [other protocols/markets]."

6/ [Prediction with conviction]
Example: "Watch for similar exploits in [timeframe]. The attack vector is now public, and copycats are already analyzing the transaction logs."

7/ [Cultural/human angle]
Example: "The real story isn't technical - it's psychological. This exploit worked because of [human behavior pattern] that crypto still hasn't solved."

8/ [Actionable takeaway + link]
Example: "Bottom line: [clear takeaway]. Full technical autopsy and what it means for your bags: [hashnhedge.com link]"

End with engagement:
"What am I missing? Drop your takes below. And if you want more analysis that cuts through the bullshit, follow @hashnhedge"
```

### Template 2: Unpopular Opinion Thread
```
Unpopular opinion: [Controversial but researched take]

Example: "Bitcoin maxis calling everything else a 'shitcoin' are actually the biggest threat to Bitcoin adoption"

[Brief supporting argument]
Example: "Maximalism worked when crypto was niche. Now it's actively turning away the normies we need for true adoption."

Everyone's celebrating [popular narrative] but they're missing [contrarian insight]

Here's why I'm probably right and definitely getting ratio'd:

üßµ 1/6

1/ [First supporting argument with data]
2/ [Counter to common objection]
3/ [Historical precedent]
4/ [What the smart money actually thinks]
5/ [Prediction based on this take]
6/ [How this plays out practically]

"Disagree? Cool. Explain why in the replies. Just bring data, not feelings."
```

### Template 3: Technical Deep Dive
```
üîç DEEP DIVE: How the [Protocol] exploit actually worked

$XXX million gone in X minutes. Here's the technical breakdown your timeline is missing:

[Attach visual: Transaction diagram or code snippet]

üßµ 1/7

1/ [Setup - what was supposed to happen]
"[Protocol] was designed to [function]. Users could [action] and earn [reward]. Simple, right? Wrong."

2/ [The vulnerability in plain English]
"The flaw was in [component]. Essentially, [simple explanation] - imagine if [relatable analogy]."

3/ [The exploit chain - step by step]
"Here's exactly how it went down:
- Step 1: [action]
- Step 2: [manipulation]
- Step 3: [profit extraction]"

4/ [Why it worked/wasn't caught]
"This worked because [reason]. Auditors missed it because [explanation]. Classic [type of oversight]."

5/ [Similar vulnerabilities elsewhere]
"The scary part? [X other protocols] use similar logic. I count at least [number] that are vulnerable to the same attack vector."

6/ [What happens next]
"Expect [predictions]. The exploit code is public now, so [consequences]."

7/ [Broader implications]
"This isn't just about [protocol]. It's about [systemic issue]. Until [solution], we'll keep seeing this."
