**Headline**: Big O Notation Simplified for Programmers  **Summary Meta Description**: Understand the fundamental concept of Big O notation, which measures algorithm efficiency, through a visual guide that breaks down time and space complexity. Learn how to analyze algorithms and optimize performance.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Big O notation is a measure of an algorithm's time or space complexity. ΓÇó It provides an upper bound on the number of operations required to solve a problem. ΓÇó Common complexities include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), and O(2^n). ΓÇó Understanding Big O notation helps programmers optimize performance and make informed decisions about algorithm choice.  **Short Takeaways:**  * Big O notation is not a measure of actual running time but rather an upper bound on the number of operations required. * By analyzing algorithms using Big O notation, programmers can identify opportunities for optimization and improve code efficiency.  **Sources**:  https://samwho.dev/big-o/
