This text appears to be a technical article about managing machine learning (ML) model artifacts on Google Cloud Platform. The author discusses the benefits of decoupling model artifacts from container images and storing them in a centralized Cloud Storage bucket, which simplifies the CI/CD pipeline, accelerates deployments, and enables independent management of code and models.  The article highlights several key points:  1. **Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver**: A high-performance, direct access solution for ML workloads on GKE. 2. **Managed Lustre** and **Hyperdisk ML**: High-throughput, low-latency storage options for AI/ML workloads. 3. **Automated ingestion pipeline**: Using a Cloud Run job to stream model artifacts from Hugging Face directly into Cloud Storage. 4. **Artifact-centric design**: A foundation for building a robust, scalable, and future-proof MLOps platform.  The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of iterating towards a mature MLOps platform, starting with a solid foundation of artifact-centric design. The author encourages readers to share their own tips on managing model artifacts through various social media platforms.  This text would likely be of interest to:  * ML engineers and researchers working with Google Cloud Platform * DevOps professionals looking for ways to simplify CI/CD pipelines and accelerate deployments * Data scientists and analysts seeking high-performance storage solutions for AI/ML workloads  To answer your original question, the article does not provide a specific numerical value or solution, but rather presents a conceptual framework for managing ML model artifacts on Google Cloud Platform.
