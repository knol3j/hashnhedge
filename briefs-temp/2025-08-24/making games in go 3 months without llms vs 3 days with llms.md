**Headline**: "Go Games: LLM-Boosted Speed vs. Hand-Coded Slowdown"  **Summary Meta Description**: "A Go developer compared the time it takes to create two card games using traditional coding methods versus leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The results show a significant speedup, but also raise questions about the trade-offs between convenience and control."  **Key Points:**  * Developing a simple card game took 3 months without LLMs, but only 3 days with LLMs. * Using LLMs reduced development time by over 90%. * The LLM-boosted version was more complex, requiring additional code to handle errors. * Traditional coding methods required manual implementation of game logic and rules.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. Large Language Models can significantly speed up the development process for certain tasks, but may also introduce complexity and dependencies on external tools. 2. The increased use of LLMs in software development raises questions about the balance between convenience and control, as well as potential issues with code maintainability and transparency.  **Sources:**  https://marianogappa.github.io/software/2025/08/24/i-made-two-card-games-in-go/
