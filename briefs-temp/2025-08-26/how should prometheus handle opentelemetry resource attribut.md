**Headline** Prometheus Struggles with OpenTelemetry Resource Attributes  **Summary Meta Description** A new UX research report from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) explores how Prometheus should handle OpenTelemetry resource attributes, highlighting challenges and potential solutions for monitoring and observability.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó The CNCF conducted a user experience research study to understand current pain points with OpenTelemetry resource attributes in Prometheus. ΓÇó Users reported difficulties in understanding and utilizing resource attributes, leading to inconsistent usage and decreased adoption of OpenTelemetry. ΓÇó Key recommendations include providing clear documentation, simplifying attribute naming conventions, and implementing attribute filtering.  **Short Takeaways**  1.  The CNCF's research underscores the need for improved user experience and better documentation around Prometheus' handling of OpenTelemetry resource attributes. 2.  Addressing these challenges is crucial for widespread adoption of OpenTelemetry and enhancing monitoring capabilities in cloud-native environments.  **Sources** https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/08/25/how-should-prometheus-handle-opentelemetry-resource-attributes-a-ux-research-report/
