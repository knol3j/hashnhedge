Here's the news brief:  **Headline:** AI Disrupts Entry-Level Jobs, Study Finds  **Summary Meta Description:** A Stanford University study reveals that artificial intelligence (AI) is having a significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the US. Researchers found that AI is increasingly displacing human labor at the starting point of careers, with implications for Gen Z job seekers.  **Key Points:**  * A new Stanford University study finds that AI is significantly impacting entry-level jobs in the US. * The researchers analyzed over 200 occupations and found that AI has a disproportionate impact on workers entering the workforce. * Study co-author Erik Brynjolfsson notes that the findings have implications for Gen Z job seekers, who are increasingly relying on automation to enter the workforce.  **Short Takeaways:**  * The study highlights the need for policymakers to consider the potential consequences of AI adoption on entry-level workers and young professionals. * As the US economy continues to shift towards greater reliance on automation, it's essential for workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than being replaced by it.  **Sources:**  Fortune - "First-of-its-kind Stanford study says AI is starting to have a 'significant and disproportionate impact' on entry-level workers in the U.S." (https://fortune.com/2025/08/26/stanford-ai-entry-level-jobs-gen-z-erik-brynjolfsson/)
