**Headline:** Trump Tariffs Touted as Economic Savior, But Experts Warn of Hidden Costs  **Summary Meta Description:** A Fortune analysis reveals that President Trump's tariffs are effectively a national sales tax, threatening US economic growth and increasing inflation. The tariffs disproportionately affect consumers, particularly low-income households.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The Trump administration's tariffs have added billions to the national debt, fueling inflation and stifling economic growth. ΓÇó The tariffs create a regressive tax system, where lower-income households bear the brunt of higher prices for imported goods. ΓÇó Critics argue that the tariffs hurt US companies by increasing costs and reducing their competitiveness in global markets.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Hidden Tax**: By shifting the burden to consumers, Trump's tariffs can be seen as a national sales tax, which may hinder economic growth. 2. **Disproportionate Impact**: Low-income households are more vulnerable to price increases, making them disproportionately affected by the tariffs.  **Sources:** [https://fortune.com/2025/08/26/trump-tariffs-us-economic-outlook-growth-inflation-debt/](https://fortune.com/2025/08/26/trump-tariffs-us-economic-outlook-growth-inflation-debt/)
