Here is the rewritten news brief:  **Headline**: "Docker Warns of 'Vendor Lock-In' with 'Hardened' Images"  **Summary Meta Description**: Docker's blog post highlights a paradox in the software supply chain, where security-focused images can actually limit developer flexibility and increase reliance on specific vendors. The post emphasizes the need for balance between security and vendor choice.  **Key Points:**  * Docker "hardened" images, designed to enhance security, may inadvertently lock developers into specific vendors. * This "vendor lock-in" can occur when organizations rely too heavily on these pre-configured images, limiting their ability to switch or customize their software environment. * The post suggests that while security is crucial, it's equally important to maintain flexibility and choice in the software supply chain.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Security vs. Flexibility**: Docker's warning highlights a delicate balance between ensuring security and maintaining flexibility in the software development process. 2. **Vendor Lock-in Risks**: The paradox of "hardened" images underscores the potential risks of vendor lock-in, which can have significant implications for organizations' long-term infrastructure and cost planning.  **Sources:**  * Docker - "The Supply Chain Paradox: When 'Hardened' Images Become a Vendor Lock-in Trap" (https://www.docker.com/blog/hardened-container-images-security-vendor-lock-in/)
