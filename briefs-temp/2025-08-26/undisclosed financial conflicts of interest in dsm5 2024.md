Here's the news brief:  **Headline**: DSM-5 Revision Criticized for Lacking Transparency on Financial Conflicts  **Summary Meta Description**: A recent analysis has highlighted the lack of transparency in financial conflicts of interest associated with the development of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) revision. Researchers argue that this omission can compromise the credibility and validity of psychiatric diagnoses.  **Key Points:**  * The DSM-5 revision was published in 2024, but the original source did not disclose financial conflicts of interest. * A recent analysis of the revision's development process revealed undisclosed conflicts of interest from pharmaceutical companies and other organizations. * These conflicts may have influenced the inclusion or exclusion of certain diagnostic criteria.  **Takeaways:**  1. The lack of transparency in financial conflicts of interest can undermine the credibility of psychiatric diagnoses, raising questions about their validity. 2. Regulatory bodies must ensure that developers of diagnostic manuals disclose potential conflicts of interest to maintain public trust in medical guidelines.  **Sources:**  https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-076902
