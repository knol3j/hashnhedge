**Headline:** Wall Street's Nvidia Obsession Ignores Threats to Fed Independence  **Summary Meta Description:** As investors focus on NVIDIA's Q2 earnings, a more pressing concern for the US economy looms in the shadows: threats to the Federal Reserve's independence. Marketwatch warns that this oversight may prove costly.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó NVIDIA reports Q2 earnings amidst market frenzy ΓÇó Wall Street largely ignores growing concerns over Fed independence ΓÇó Threats to central bank autonomy could have far-reaching economic implications ΓÇó Analysts argue that investors are "overlooking" potential risks  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The fixation on tech stocks like NVIDIA may distract from more pressing economic issues, such as the erosion of the Federal Reserve's authority. 2. As the US economy grapples with rising debt levels and global uncertainty, maintaining central bank independence is crucial to ensure monetary policy can adapt to changing circumstances.  **Sources:**  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-is-more-focused-on-nvidia-than-on-threats-to-fed-independence-that-may-be-a-big-mistake-bb489aaa?mod=mw_rss_topstories
