**Headline**: Google Tracks Cost of Quantum-Factorization Attack on RSA Encryption  **Summary Meta Description**: Researchers at Google's cryptographic analysis team have been tracking the cost of a quantum factoring attack on widely used RSA encryption algorithms. The study reveals the increasing economic viability of such an attack, raising concerns about post-quantum cryptography.  **Key Points:**  * Google's researchers simulated a quantum computer to estimate the cost of breaking 2048-bit RSA keys. * The estimated cost for breaking these keys decreased by a factor of approximately 2 every year from 2016 to 2025. * The team found that it would take a few hundred million dollars to break a 2048-bit key in the current timeframe.  **Takeaways with Light Analysis:**  1. **Quantum threat escalates**: As quantum computing advances, the cost of breaking RSA keys decreases significantly. This underscores the urgency for transitioning to post-quantum cryptography. 2. **RSA's diminishing security margin**: The study highlights that RSA's key size, once considered secure, may no longer provide adequate protection against a determined adversary with access to a powerful quantum computer.  **Sources:** Google Security Blog: "Tracking the Cost of Quantum Factoring" (https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/tracking-cost-of-quantum-factori.html)
