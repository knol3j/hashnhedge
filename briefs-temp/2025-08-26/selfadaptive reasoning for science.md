Here is the news brief based on the source:  **Headline** Microsoft Develops AI Reasoning Framework for Scientific Research  **Summary Meta Description** Microsoft researchers have developed a self-adaptive reasoning framework that enables AI systems to reason and make decisions in scientific research. The framework uses machine learning algorithms to adapt to new data and improve reasoning performance over time.  **Key Points**  ΓÇó Microsoft's self-adaptive reasoning framework combines symbolic and connectionist reasoning to enable AI systems to reason about complex scientific concepts. ΓÇó The framework uses machine learning algorithms to adapt to new data and improve reasoning performance over time. ΓÇó Initial results show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in several scientific tasks, including material property prediction and protein function inference.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis**  1. **Adaptability is key**: Microsoft's self-adaptive reasoning framework highlights the importance of adaptability in AI systems for scientific research. As new data becomes available, the system can adjust its reasoning approach to improve performance. 2. **Hybrid approaches**: The use of both symbolic and connectionist reasoning demonstrates that hybrid approaches may be more effective than traditional methods in tackling complex scientific problems.  **Sources** Source: Microsoft Research Blog - "Self-adaptive reasoning for science" (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/self-adaptive-reasoning-for-science/)
