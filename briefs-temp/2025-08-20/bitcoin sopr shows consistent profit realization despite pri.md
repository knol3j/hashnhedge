**Headline** Bitcoin Profit Realizations Remain Steady Amid Price Drop  **Summary Meta Description** Despite a recent price decline, Bitcoin's Selling Price Realized (SOPR) metric indicates consistent profit realization among holders. This trend suggests that investors are holding onto their assets rather than selling at a loss.  **Key Points:**  * Bitcoin SOPR has remained relatively steady since the beginning of 2023 * The metric measures the average price at which coins were sold compared to their acquisition cost * A high SOPR indicates that holders are selling at a profit, while a low value suggests selling at a loss  **Short Takeaways with Analysis**  1. **Bitcoin's Price Drop Not Reflected in Sellers' Motivations**: The steady SOPR metric shows that investors are not panic-selling due to the recent price drop, indicating a stable market sentiment. 2. **Holders Still Holding On to Profits**: Despite the price decline, holders are choosing to maintain their profits rather than selling at a loss, suggesting a cautious and strategic approach to investment.  **Sources**  * https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-sopr-shows-consistent-profit-realization-despite-price-pullback/
