This mass exodus is attributed to the current market downturn affecting cryptocurrency prices.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The total net outflow from US-based ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum amounts to over $1 billion. ΓÇó This decline comes amidst a broader market sell-off, which has impacted cryptocurrency prices. ΓÇó Institutional investors are believed to be among those reducing their exposure to these funds. ΓÇó Despite this, the assets under management for some of the largest US-listed ETFs remain above $10 billion.  **Takeaways:**  1. The current market conditions seem to have led institutional investors to reevaluate their investment strategies in Bitcoin and Ethereum. 2.
