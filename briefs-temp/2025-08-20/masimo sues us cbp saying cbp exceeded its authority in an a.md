Here is the rewritten news brief:  **Headline** Masimo Sues US CBP Over Apple Watch Feature Ruling  **Summary Meta Description** Medical technology company Masimo has filed a lawsuit against the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency, claiming that a recent ruling exceeded its authority. The dispute centers around an August 1 decision that allowed Apple to reenable a blood oxygen tracking feature on its Watches.  **Key Points:**  * Masimo alleges that CBP's internal advice ruling enabled Apple to circumvent the company's patent rights. * The August 1 decision was made in response to Apple's request for clarification on using Watch features while complying with US trade restrictions. * This is not the first time Masimo has clashed with tech companies over its intellectual property; a similar dispute with Fitbit led to a $15 million settlement.  **Takeaways:**  * The lawsuit highlights ongoing tensions between medical technology companies and Silicon Valley giants, as these firms navigate complex patent landscapes and regulatory gray areas. * The dispute also underscores the challenges of balancing innovation and intellectual property rights in the tech industry.  **Sources:**  http://www.techmeme.com/250820/p51#a250820p51
