Here is the requested news brief:  **Headline:** CrowdStrike Tops Revenue Estimates, Lowers Q3 Outlook  **Summary Meta Description:** Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike reports a 21% year-over-year increase in Q2 revenue to $1.17 billion, surpassing estimates of $1.15 billion. However, the company forecasts Q3 revenue below expectations, causing its stock price to drop over 4%.  **Key Points:**  * CrowdStrike's Q2 revenue reached $1.17 billion, a 21% increase from the same period last year * The company surpassed analyst estimates of $1.15 billion in Q2 revenue * CrowdStrike forecasts Q3 revenue below expectations, citing "increased uncertainty" and a "more challenging" market environment  **Takeaways:**  1. Despite beating revenue estimates, CrowdStrike's stock price declined over 4% after hours, suggesting that investors are concerned about the company's lowered Q3 outlook. 2. The cybersecurity industry has been experiencing increased competition and pricing pressure in recent quarters, which may be contributing to CrowdStrike's cautious forecast.  **Sources:** Source: Jake Bleiberg, Bloomberg (http://www.techmeme.com/250827/p37#a250827p37)
