**Headline:** Mobile Phishers Target Brokerage Accounts in "Ramp and Dump" Scheme  **Summary Meta Description:** Mobile phishers are using a new tactic to target brokerage accounts, exploiting vulnerabilities in online trading platforms to steal funds. The scheme involves rapidly buying up stocks to inflate their value before selling them for a quick profit.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Mobile phishing scams have become increasingly sophisticated, with attackers using fake apps and convincing messages to trick victims into revealing sensitive information. ΓÇó Once inside the brokerage account, the phishers use automated trading software to rapidly buy up shares in specific stocks, inflating their value before selling them for a quick profit. ΓÇó This "ramp and dump" scheme is particularly effective because it takes advantage of the delayed settlement period in online trading, allowing attackers to quickly cash out before losses can be incurred.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The rise of mobile phishing scams highlights the need for online brokerage platforms to invest in more robust security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and real-time monitoring. 2. This scheme also underscores the importance of users being cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or downloading new apps, especially those related to finance.  **Sources:** https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/mobile-phishers-target-brokerage-accounts-in-ramp-and-dump-cashout-scheme/
