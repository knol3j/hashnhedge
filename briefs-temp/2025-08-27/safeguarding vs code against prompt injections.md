Here is the news brief based on the source:  **Headline**: VS Code Vulnerable to Prompt Injection Attacks  **Summary Meta Description**: Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has been found vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. Researchers have identified multiple vulnerabilities and proposed fixes.  **Key Points**:  * VS Code is susceptible to prompt injection attacks due to a lack of input validation in the `vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider` API. * Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious prompts that inject code into the IDE, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution. * Researchers have identified multiple vulnerabilities in VS Code, including CVE-2022-35914 and CVE-2022-35915.  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis**  1. The discovery highlights the importance of robust input validation in software development environments like VS Code. If left unaddressed, such vulnerabilities can lead to serious security breaches. 2. The fact that multiple vulnerabilities were identified suggests a need for more comprehensive testing and validation processes within Microsoft's development pipeline.  **Sources**: GitHub Blog Security - Vulnerability Research: Safeguarding VS Code against prompt injections (https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/safeguarding-vs-code-against-prompt-injections/)
