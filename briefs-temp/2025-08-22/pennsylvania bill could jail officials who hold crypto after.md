**Headline:** Penn. Bill Targets Officials with Crypto Holdings  **Summary Meta Description:** A proposed bill in Pennsylvania could lead to jail time for public officials who fail to declare or dispose of cryptocurrency assets within a 90-day deadline, sparking debate on the balance between transparency and financial freedom.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó The bill aims to hold government officials accountable for their crypto holdings, echoing concerns about corruption and money laundering. ΓÇó Officials would face imprisonment if they are found to be in possession of cryptocurrencies beyond the designated timeframe without proper declaration or disposal. ΓÇó Critics argue that the measure is overly restrictive, potentially infringing on individuals' right to financial autonomy.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. The bill's passage could set a precedent for other states to follow suit, further increasing scrutiny on public officials' personal finances. 2. While proponents argue that enhanced transparency is necessary, opponents counter that this may be an overreach in regulating individual financial decisions.  **Sources:**  https://cryptoslate.com/pennsylvania-bill-could-jail-officials-who-hold-crypto-after-90-days/
