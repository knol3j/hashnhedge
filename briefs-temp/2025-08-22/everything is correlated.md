**Headline:** Correlation Epidemic Spreads Across Disciplines  **Meta Description:** A study reveals widespread correlation in scientific literature, highlighting the challenge of distinguishing cause from effect in modern research. The author examines various fields, including medicine, social sciences, and economics, to demonstrate the pervasiveness of spurious correlations.  **Key Points:**  * Correlation is not causation, yet it remains a pervasive issue in scientific research. * Studies across multiple disciplines show high rates of correlation without clear causal relationships. * The problem stems from a combination of factors, including flawed study design and publication bias.  **Takeaways:**  1. **The line between correlation and causation has become increasingly blurred**: As researchers seek to identify patterns in complex data sets, the risk of misinterpreting correlations as causes grows. 2. **Critique and replication are essential for establishing true causal relationships**: By acknowledging and addressing these issues, scientists can improve research quality and reliability.  **Sources:**  https://gwern.net/everything
