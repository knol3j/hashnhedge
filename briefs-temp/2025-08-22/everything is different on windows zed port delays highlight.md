**Headline:** Zed Port Delay Highlights Windows Cross-Platform Challenges  **Summary Meta Description:** The development of a Windows port for the Rust-based editor Zed is experiencing delays due to the complexities of making low-level code cross-platform on Microsoft's operating system. Graphics API, crash reporting, and other issues are hindering progress.  **Key Points:**  * Zed co-founder Max Brunfield cited the difficulties in developing a cross-platform application for Windows. * Making low-level code compatible with Windows is proving to be a significant challenge. * Graphics API, crash reporting, and other features are being affected by these compatibility issues.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Windows' Unique Challenges**: The delay in Zed's Windows port highlights the difficulties developers face when creating cross-platform applications for Microsoft's operating system. Unlike other platforms, Windows has its own set of unique requirements that can cause friction. 2. **Cross-Platform Complexity**: As more applications strive to be compatible across various platforms, developers are encountering a range of complexities, from graphics API differences to crash reporting variations.  **Sources:**  https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/22/everything_is_different_on_windows/
