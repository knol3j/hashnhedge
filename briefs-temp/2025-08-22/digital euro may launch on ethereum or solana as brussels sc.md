**Headline** "Ethereum and Solana in the Running to Host Digital Euro"  **Meta Description** "The European Union is exploring the possibility of launching its digital euro on Ethereum or Solana blockchain platforms. The decision would mark a significant shift towards decentralization, offering the EU greater control over its monetary policy."  **Key Points**  ΓÇó The European Central Bank (ECB) is considering using a decentralized platform for the digital euro, citing concerns about sovereignty. ΓÇó Ethereum and Solana are among the top contenders to host the digital euro, with their scalable and secure networks appealing to EU policymakers. ΓÇó A decentralized platform would allow the ECB to maintain control over monetary policy, reducing reliance on traditional financial systems.  **Short Takeaways**  The European Union's decision to explore a decentralized platform for the digital euro reflects growing concerns about sovereignty in a rapidly digitizing world. By choosing Ethereum or Solana, the EU may be prioritizing flexibility and scalability over security and regulatory oversight.  This development highlights the increasingly blurred lines between traditional fiat currency and blockchain-based alternatives. As the global economy continues to shift towards digital transactions, central banks like the ECB will need to adapt their strategies to maintain relevance.  **Sources** * https://cryptoslate.com/digital-euro-may-launch-on-ethereum-or-solana-as-brussels-scrambles-for-sovereignty/
