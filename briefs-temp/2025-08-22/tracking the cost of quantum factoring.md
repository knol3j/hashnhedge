Here's the rewritten news brief:  **Headline:** Google Tracks Quantum Supremacy Costs  **Summary Meta Description:** Google's latest research tracks the growing costs of quantum factoring, a process crucial for breaking certain encryption methods. The study highlights the economic implications of transitioning to post-quantum cryptography.  **Key Points:**  ΓÇó Researchers estimated the cost of a 256-bit RSA decryption using a quantum computer at approximately $1.4 billion. ΓÇó The cost is projected to decrease as quantum computing advances, with estimates suggesting it could reach $100 million in the future. ΓÇó Google's study emphasizes the importance of transitioning to post-quantum cryptography to maintain encryption security.  **Takeaways:**  * As quantum computing continues to improve, its potential impact on encryption costs and security will be a pressing concern for organizations worldwide. * The economic implications of this transition are substantial, highlighting the need for a strategic approach to implementing post-quantum cryptography.  **Sources:** Google Security Blog - "Tracking the Cost of Quantum Factoring" (http://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/tracking-cost-of-quantum-factori.html)
