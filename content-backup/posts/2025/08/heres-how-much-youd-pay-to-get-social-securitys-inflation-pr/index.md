**Headline:** "Private Inflation Protection Options Fall Short"  **Summary Meta Description:** "MarketWatch analysis reveals that self-purchasing inflation-adjusted annuities may not be as attractive as relying on Social Security's built-in cost of living adjustments, despite initial savings projections."  **Key Points:**  * Self-insuring against inflation through private annuities can be costly and potentially less effective than relying on Social Security's cost of living adjustments (COLAs). * MarketWatch analysis shows that private annuity options often require higher upfront payments to achieve similar long-term value as Social Security COLAs. * The appeal of self-insurance is diminished by the added complexity, costs, and potential risks associated with these alternatives.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Social Security's COLAs remain a compelling option**: Despite initial savings projections, private annuities often fail to match the long-term value offered by Social Security's built-in inflation protection. 2. **Complexity and risk outweigh benefits**: The added complexity and costs associated with self-insuring against inflation may not be worth the potential savings for many individuals.  **Sources:**  * MarketWatch - "This Inflation-Adjusted Annuity Beats Anything Insurance Companies Offer" (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-inflation-adjusted-annuity-beats-anything-insurance-companies-offer-11bde5cf?mod=mw_rss_topstories)
