**Headline:** "Future of Open-Source Maintained by Who?"  **Summary Meta Description:** "The future of open-source projects is uncertain as current maintainers retire, leaving a void in leadership. Researchers explore new models for succession and community engagement to ensure the longevity of these projects."  **Key Points:**  * Many open-source projects face a crisis due to aging maintainer populations * Current models focus on individual maintainers rather than communities or organizations * New research suggests shifting towards collaborative governance structures * Open-source leadership is being rethought for a new generation  **Short Takeaways with Analysis:**  1. The current reliance on individual maintainers poses significant risks, as these individuals often retire without clear succession plans in place. 2. A shift towards more distributed and community-driven governance models could ensure the continued growth and development of open-source projects.  **Sources:** https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/who-will-maintain-the-future-rethinking-open-source-leadership-for-a-new-generation/
