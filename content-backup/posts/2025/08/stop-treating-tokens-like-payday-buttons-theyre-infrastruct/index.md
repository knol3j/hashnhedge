Here is the news brief:  **Headline** Tokenized Infrastructure Needs a Different Approach  **Summary Meta Description** The crypto industry is shifting towards tokenized infrastructure, but it's essential to recognize that tokens serve as more than just digital payment methods. Experts argue that treating them solely as payday buttons oversimplifies their potential and overlooks the need for robust infrastructure development.  **Key Points**  * Tokenized infrastructure is gaining traction in the crypto industry * Tokens are being used for a range of applications beyond digital payments * The current approach to tokens is often simplistic, neglecting their potential as infrastructure components * Developers must adopt a more nuanced understanding of token capabilities and limitations  **Short Takeaways with Analysis**  1. **Tokens are not just payment tools**: While tokens can facilitate transactions, they also enable complex interactions between users and systems. Treating them solely as payday buttons restricts their true potential. 2. **Infrastructure development is crucial**: To fully leverage the benefits of tokenized infrastructure, developers must prioritize building robust, scalable platforms that support a wide range of applications.  **Sources** https://cryptoslate.com/stop-treating-tokens-like-payday-buttons-theyre-infrastructure/
