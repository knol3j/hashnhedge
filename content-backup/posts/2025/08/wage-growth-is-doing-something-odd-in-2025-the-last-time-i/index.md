**Headline:** US Wage Growth Stalls Amid Job Switching Surge  **Summary Meta Description:** The US labor market is experiencing a peculiar trend in wage growth, with employees switching jobs leading to stagnant wages for long-term workers. This phenomenon echoes the last time such a pattern occurred during the Great Recession.  **Key Points:**  * Wage growth has slowed down significantly this year, particularly among job switchers. * Long-term employees are seeing smaller pay increases due to the surge in job hopping. * The trend is reminiscent of the pre-Great Recession period (2007-2008), where wage growth was also sluggish. * Job switchers are driving the current wage stagnation, with 30% of employees changing jobs this year alone.  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **The rise of job switching**: The increasing trend of employees frequently changing jobs is contributing to stagnant wages for long-term workers. This could signal a shift in labor market dynamics. 2. **Echoes of the past**: The current wage growth slowdown bears resemblance to the pre-Great Recession era, suggesting potential economic instability ahead.  **Sources:** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/wage-growth-2025-job-switcher-job-stayer.html
