Here is the requested news brief:  **Headline:** EU Over-Regulation Hobbles Business Growth  **Summary Meta Description:** The European Union's strict regulations are stifling business growth and innovation, according to a recent report. Over-regulation is hindering companies' ability to adapt to changing market conditions, limiting their capacity for innovation and expansion.  **Key Points:**  * EU regulations are increasingly complex and burdensome, driving up costs for businesses * Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are disproportionately affected by over-regulation * The EU's "one-size-fits-all" approach to regulation is not tailored to the needs of individual member states  **Short Takeaways:**  1. Over-regulation can have a chilling effect on business growth, as companies become increasingly risk-averse in the face of complex and changing regulatory requirements. 2. The EU must strike a balance between protecting consumers and promoting business innovation, rather than prioritizing one over the other.  **Sources:** https://about.fb.com/news/2025/08/how-eu-over-regulation-is-stifling-business-growth-and-innovation/
