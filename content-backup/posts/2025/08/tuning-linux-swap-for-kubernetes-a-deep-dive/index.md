**Headline:** "Tuning Linux Swap for Kubernetes: Expert Tips for Performance and Stability"  **Summary Meta Description:** "Learn how to optimize Linux swap settings for improved performance and stability in Kubernetes clusters. Discover expert tips on tuning kernel parameters, managing memory pressure zones, and preventing OOM kills."  **Key Points:**  * Enabling swap can improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills * Key kernel parameters for swap tuning include `vm.swappiness`, `vm.min_free_kbytes`, and `vm.watermark_scale_factor` * Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet's eviction logic * Properly configuring these parameters is critical for achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters  **Short Takeaways:**  1. **Swappiness matters**: The kernel's choice between reclaiming anonymous memory (swapping) and dropping page cache is influenced by the `vm.swappiness` parameter. 2. **Watermark tuning**: Properly configuring `vm.min_free_kbytes` and `vm.watermark_scale_factor` can prevent OOM kills and eviction during sudden memory allocation spikes. 3. **Workload-dependent settings**: Optimal swap settings depend on the workload, so careful benchmarking is necessary to determine the best configuration.  **Recommendations:**  * Use a starting point of `vm.swappiness=60`, `vm.min_free_kbytes=500000` (500MB), and `vm.watermark_scale_factor=2000` * Perform thorough benchmark testing with your own workloads in test environments * Consider using SSD-backed storage for swap to improve performance
