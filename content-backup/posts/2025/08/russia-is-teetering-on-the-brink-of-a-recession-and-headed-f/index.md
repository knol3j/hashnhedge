**Headline** Russia's Economy Teeters on Recession, Ukraine War Takes Toll  **Summary Meta Description** Russia's economy is facing a potential recession amidst the ongoing Ukraine war, with a disastrous harvest season expected to exacerbate the situation. The economic downturn will likely impact Putin's cash reserves, which rely heavily on oil and gas exports.  **Key Points**  * Russia's economy may be heading towards a recession due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. * A poor harvest season is predicted, further straining the country's resources. * Oil and gas export revenues, a key source of funding for Putin's regime, are expected to decline. * Inflation remains high, with some experts predicting it could reach 20% by year-end.  **Short Takeaways**  1. The Ukraine war has taken a significant toll on Russia's economy, putting its recovery at risk. As the conflict persists, economic conditions will likely continue to deteriorate. 2.
