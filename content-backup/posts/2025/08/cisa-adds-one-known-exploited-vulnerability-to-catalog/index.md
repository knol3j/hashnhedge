**Headline** CISA Adds One New Vulnerability to Its KEV Catalog  **Summary Meta Description** The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. This comes as part of ongoing efforts to prioritize timely remediation of vulnerabilities that pose significant risks to federal networks.  **Key Points:**  * The newly added vulnerability is CVE-2025-43300, affecting Apple iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices. * This vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write issue, a common type exploited by malicious actors. * CISA's Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 requires federal agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities within specified timelines.  **Short Takeaways with Light Analysis**  1. **Prioritizing Remediation**: The addition of this vulnerability to the KEV Catalog underscores the importance of timely remediation in reducing exposure to cyberattacks. 2. **Broader Implications**: While BOD 22-01 primarily targets federal agencies, CISA urges all organizations to follow a similar vulnerability management practice for their networks.  **Sources** https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/08/21/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog
