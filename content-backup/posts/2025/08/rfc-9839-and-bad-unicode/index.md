**Headline** RFC 9839 Criticized for Handling of Unicode Characters  **Summary Meta Description** The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has published RFC 9839, a document that outlines a new approach to handling Unicode characters. However, experts have raised concerns about the proposal's ability to correctly identify and process these characters.  **Bullet Key Points**  * The IETF has published RFC 9839, which aims to standardize the way systems handle Unicode characters. * Critics argue that the proposal may lead to incorrect identification of Unicode characters. * The draft has been criticized for its potential impact on security and user experience.  **Short Takeaways with Analysis**  1. **Lack of clarity**: Experts are concerned that RFC 9839's approach may not provide clear guidelines for handling Unicode characters, potentially leading to inconsistencies in implementation. 2. **Security implications**: If the proposal is adopted without addressing these concerns, it could have far-reaching consequences for security and user experience.  **Sources** https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/08/14/RFC9839
