Here is the news brief:  **Headline:** "Acronis True Image Drains System Resources"  **Summary Meta Description:** "Popular backup software Acronis True Image has been found to consume significant system resources, even when not actively running backups. Researchers discovered that the program's resident component can cause performance issues and CPU usage spikes."  **Bullet Key Points:**  * Acronis True Image's resident component can consume up to 20% of CPU resources. * Even when not actively backing up data, the software continues to run in the background, using system resources. * Performance issues are more pronounced on systems with multiple users or heavy workload.  **Takeaways:**  1. Users may want to reconsider running Acronis True Image as a resident component, especially on systems with limited resources. A one-time scan and manual backup schedule might be a more efficient approach. 2. The discovery highlights the importance of monitoring system resource usage and adjusting software settings accordingly to avoid performance issues.  **Sources:**  https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2025/05/26/acronis-true-image-costs-performance-when-not-used/
