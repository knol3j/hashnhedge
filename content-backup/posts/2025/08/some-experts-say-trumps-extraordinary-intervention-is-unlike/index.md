**Headline:** "Trump's Intervention Unlikely to Save Intel Amid Yields, Competition Concerns"  **Summary Meta Description:** "US President Trump intervenes in Intel's struggles, but experts question its impact as the chipmaker faces poor yields and intense competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Nvidia. Can government support revive Intel's fortunes or is it too late?"  **Key Points:**  * US President Trump has made an extraordinary intervention in Intel's struggles * Experts say government support may not be enough to save Intel due to its poor yields and intense competition from TSMC and Nvidia * Intel faces significant challenges in the semiconductor market, with declining sales and revenue * The company is also struggling to maintain high production yields, a critical factor in the industry  **Takeaways:**  1. **Government Support May Not be Enough**: While Trump's intervention may provide some temporary relief for Intel, experts believe it may not be enough to address the underlying issues of poor yields and intense competition. 2. **Industry Consolidation Continues**: The struggles of Intel highlight the ongoing consolidation in the semiconductor industry, with smaller players facing significant challenges from larger rivals.  **Sources:** http://www.techmeme.com/250823/p10#a250823p10
