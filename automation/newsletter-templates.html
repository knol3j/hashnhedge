## Email Automation Sequences

### Welcome Series (5 emails over 2 weeks)

#### Email 1: Welcome + Expectations Setting
```
Subject: Welcome to the grey area (where the interesting stuff happens)

Hey {{first_name}},

Welcome to Hash & Hedge. You've just signed up for analysis that doesn't sugarcoat the chaos of crypto, tech, and the beautiful disasters where they intersect.

Here's what you can expect:

Every week, you'll get our chaos report - a brutally honest breakdown of:
- The week's biggest financial and technical disasters
- Market psychology analysis (why people do stupid things with money)
- Security vulnerabilities that actually matter
- Cultural commentary on the tech/crypto intersection
- Predictions that will either age beautifully or embarrassingly

We don't shill bags, pump tokens, or pretend markets are rational. We just document the real-time evolution of money and technology with the honesty your timeline is missing.

First week's reading to get you started:
- [Link to best market psychology article]
- [Link to best technical analysis]
- [Link to best cultural commentary]

Reply and tell me what you want to see more of. I actually read these emails.

Welcome to the grey,
Hash & Hedge

P.S. If this isn't what you signed up for, unsubscribe link is below. No hard feelings.
```

#### Email 2: Best of Technical Analysis
```
Subject: The $197M math problem (and why it won't be the last)

{{first_name}},

Since you're new here, thought you'd appreciate this: our technical breakdown of how someone turned a math error into $197 million.

[Link to Euler analysis]

This isn't just about one exploit. It's about why DeFi's greatest strength (composability) is also its greatest vulnerability.

The pattern repeats because the incentives haven't changed:
- Protocols optimize for capital efficiency over security
- Auditors check code, not economic assumptions  
- Users chase yield without understanding risks

More technical deep dives coming your way. The goal isn't to scare you away from DeFi - it's to help you understand the real risks behind the marketing.

-Hash & Hedge
```

#### Email 3: Market Psychology Deep Dive
```
Subject: Why smart people make stupid trades (psychology > technology)

{{first_name}},

Here's an uncomfortable truth: Most crypto losses aren't from hacks or rug pulls. They're from perfectly intelligent people making emotional decisions with their money.

[Link to market psychology article]

The technology is fascinating. The psychology is predictable:
- FOMO drives entries at tops
- Fear drives exits at bottoms  
- Hope keeps people holding bags
- Greed makes them leverage up

Understanding this pattern is more valuable than understanding blockchain technology. Markets are made of people, and people are wonderfully irrational.

Next week: Why everyone's wrong about regulation.

### Re-engagement Campaign (3 emails for inactive subscribers)

#### Email 1: "Miss me yet?"
```
Subject: The chaos you've been missing

{{first_name}},

Haven't seen you around lately. Either you've found inner peace and transcended the need for financial chaos analysis, or our emails ended up in spam.

In case it's the latter, here's what you missed:

[3 biggest stories with compelling hooks]

If you want back in: [Link to update preferences]
If you're done with us: [Link to unsubscribe]

No judgment either way.
