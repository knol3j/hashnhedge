## Integrating with Your Pipeline

### Your Existing Automation
Your `pipeline/publish.ps1` script should work with minimal modifications:

1. **Update the site directory:**
   ```powershell
   # Change from:
   $siteDir = "C:\Users\gnul\hashnhedge\site"
   # To:
   $siteDir = "C:\Users\gnul\hashnhedge\site-new"
   ```

2. **Update the build command:**
   ```powershell
   # Change from:
   hugo --gc --minify
   # To:
   npm run build
   ```

### Content Generation
Your AI content generation can continue exactly as before, just ensure:
- YAML front matter uses proper quotes
- No Unicode characters in front matter
- Standard structure: title, date, category, tags, description

### Sample Post Format
```yaml
---
title: "Your Article Title"
date: 2025-08-24T10:00:00Z
author: Hash & Hedge
categories: ["Markets", "Crypto"]
tags: ["bitcoin", "markets", "psychology"]
featured_image: "../assets/images/featured/featured-img-placeholder.png"
description: "Article description for SEO"
---

Your article content here...
```

## Going Live

### Option 1: Replace Old Site
When ready, run:
```powershell
# Back up old site
Move-Item C:\Users\gnul\hashnhedge\site C:\Users\gnul\hashnhedge\site-old
# Move new site into place  
Move-Item C:\Users\gnul\hashnhedge\site-new C:\Users\gnul\hashnhedge\site
```

### Option 2: Fresh Deploy
Deploy `site-new/public/` folder to your GitHub Pages or hosting provider.

## Content Recovery

If you want to recover any articles from your original content, they're backed up in:
- `C:\Users\gnul\hashnhedge\content-backup/`

You can manually fix the YAML issues in important articles and add them to the new site.

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Development with live reload
- `npm install` - Update dependencies (occasionally)

### Adding New Posts
1. Create `.md` file in `content/posts/`
2. Use proper YAML front matter (see sample above)
3. Write content in Markdown
4. Build and deploy
