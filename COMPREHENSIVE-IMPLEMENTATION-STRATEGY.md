# Comprehensive Infrastructure Remediation Strategy
# Hash & Hedge - Systematic Technical Implementation

## Phase 1: Immediate Infrastructure Fixes

### 1.1 GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization
The current build failures require systematic remediation of the submodule configuration:

**Current Issue Analysis:**
- Submodule path: site/themes/newsroom
- Error: "fatal: No url found for submodule path 'site/themes/newsroom' in .gitmodules"
- Impact: Complete CI/CD pipeline failure

**Systematic Remediation Steps:**

1. **Submodule Re-initialization** (Execute locally first):
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\gnul\hashnhedge
   git submodule deinit site/themes/newsroom
   git rm site/themes/newsroom
   git submodule add https://github.com/onweru/newsroom.git site/themes/newsroom
   git commit -m "fix: re-initialize newsroom theme submodule"
   ```

2. **Workflow Configuration Enhancement** (Already implemented):
   - Added `submodules: recursive` to checkout action
   - Included explicit submodule synchronization step
   - Enhanced error handling and validation

3. **Local Validation Process**:
   ```bash
   hugo --gc --minify -s site -d public
   # Validate successful build before pushing
   ```
