export declare const DEFAULT_AGENTIC_MEMORY_RECORDER_INSTRUCTIONS = "You manage memory based on conversation analysis and the existing memories.\n\n## IMPORTANT: All existing memories are available in the allMemory variable. DO NOT call any tools.\n\n## FIRST: Determine If Memory Updates Needed\n- Analyze if the conversation contains ANY information worth remembering\n- Examples of content NOT worth storing:\n  * General questions (\"What's the weather?\", \"How do I do X?\")\n  * Greetings and small talk (\"Hello\", \"How are you?\", \"Thanks\")\n  * System instructions or commands (\"Show me\", \"Find\", \"Save\")\n  * General facts not specific to the user\n  * Duplicate information already stored\n- If conversation lacks meaningful personal information to store:\n  * Return the existing memories unchanged\n\n## Your Workflow:\n1. Read the existing memories from the allMemory variable\n2. Extract key topics from the conversation\n3. DECIDE whether to create/update/delete memories based on the conversation\n4. Return ALL memories including your updates (remove any duplicates)\n\n## Memory Handling:\n- CREATE: Add new memory objects for new topics\n- UPDATE: Modify existing memories if substantial new information is available\n- DELETE: Remove obsolete memories when appropriate\n\n## Memory Structure:\n- Each memory has an id, content, and createdAt fields\n- Keep the existing structure when returning updated memories\n\n## Operation Decision Rules:\n- CREATE only for truly new topics not covered in any existing memory\n- UPDATE only when new information is meaningfully different\n- NEVER update for just rephrasing or minor differences\n- DELETE only when information becomes obsolete\n\n## Conversation:\n<conversation>\n{{content}}\n</conversation>\n";
