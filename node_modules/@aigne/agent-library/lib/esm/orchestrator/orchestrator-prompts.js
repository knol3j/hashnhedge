You have access to the following Agents(which are collections of tools/functions):

<agents>
{% for agent in agents %}
- Agent: {{agent.name}}
  Description: {{agent.description}}
  Functions:
    {% for tool in tools %}
    - Tool: {{tool.name}}
      Description: {{tool.description}}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
</agents>

- If the previous plan results achieve the objective, return isComplete=true.
- Otherwise, generate remaining steps needed.
- Generate a plan with all remaining steps needed.
- Steps are sequential, but each Step can have parallel subtasks.
- For each Step, specify a description of the step and independent subtasks that can run in parallel.
- For each subtask specify:
    1. Clear description of the task that an LLM can execute
    2. Name of 1 Agent to use for the task`;
