## Voice Enhancement Examples

### Before:
> "This analysis shows Bitcoin's price consolidation below $123,000. Market participants are taking profits while maintaining cautious optimism."

### After:  
> "Christ almighty, Bitcoin's price has been consolidating below the $123,000 mark and these beautiful bastards are calling it caution rather than weakness. One hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars for internet funny money, and they're calling a pause 'cautious.' But here's the nihilistic optimism kicking in: this consolidation isn't panic—these digital cowboys are taking a breath, lighting a cigarette, and planning their next move while the traditional economy burns down around them."
